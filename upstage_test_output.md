Abstract

The semiconductor industry is a competitive, complicated and a cyclical sector with a highly dynamic business
climate which requires an effective leadership style to operate and succeed. This study explores the important issue
of how leadership facilitates employee innovative work behaviors in the semiconductor industry. Based on the
assumptions of the ambidextrous leadership theory and social exchange theory, we collected data from 300 workers
employed in the semiconductor industry2) the mediating effects of workers decision-making autonomy and workplace
of South Korea. The study investigated (1) the impact of ambidextrous
leadership on innovative work behavior,
learning in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work behavior, (3) the moderating role
of resistance to change in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and workplace learning, and (4) the
moderating role of openness to experience in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work
behavior. SmartPLS 4 and SPSS v24 was used to analyze our data. The study revealed that ambidextrous leadership
positively influences workers innovative work behavior. In addition, decision-making autonomy and workplace learning
partially mediated the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work behavior. Moreover,
resistance to change was found to be a significant moderator in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership
and workplace learning. Based on these findings, we conclude that ambidextrous leadership is very imperative for
semiconductor businesses seeking to foster employee innovative work behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications
of the study are also discussed.

# 1. Introduction

The semiconductor industry is a complicated,
cyclical sector with a highly dynamic business
climate, where crucial market share and billions
of dollars are involved. Semiconductors can be
divided into four main categories: micropro-
cessors, memory chips, commodity integrated
circuits, and complex systems on a chip. The
industry has expanded continuously as a result
of its connection to daily life, since we now rely
increasingly on high-tech gadgets like tablets,
smartphones, high-definition LCD televisions,
and smart clothes washing machines. The grow-
ing demand for high-tech equipment has led to
an increase in the use of components including
transistors, computer chips, microprocessors, and
diodes. As a result, the global semiconductor in-
dustry has become very competitive with major
industry giants like Samsung, Intel, SK Hynix,
Taiwan semiconductor, Qualcomm, Micron,
NVIDIA, ASML Holding, Texas instruments, etc
playing a pivotal role in the industry. According
to data available, the global semiconductor in-
dustry's earnings have grown consistently over
the past ten years, hitting 550 billion dollars in
2021 and this can be attributed to the ongoing
introduction of new market drivers and applica-
tions which has made it easier for semiconductor
exports to rise (Alsop, 2022).

South Korea's semiconductor industry is a vital
component of the global industry since it is the
number 1 memory semiconductor industry in the
world and the second largest semiconductor pro-
ducing country (OMDIA, 2021). According to a
report by Korea Semiconductor Industry Asso-
ciation (KSIA), South Korea's semiconductor ex -
ports in 2020 were worth $97.9 billion, which ac-

counted for about 17.4% of the country's total
exports (KSIA, 2020). Currently, the semi-
conductor industry is the backbone of the Korean
economy and this success story could not have
been possible without the right leadership style
in the various semiconductor companies. Leader-
ship is essential for success in the high-tech semi-
conductor industry because it plays a crucial role
in assisting industry organizations in fulfilling
their missions in a highly competitive and dynam-
ic environment. The semiconductor industry has
therefore seen explosive expansion in the 20th
century, coinciding with significant changes in
commercial markets, the form of organizations,
and the leadership qualities required for success
in those organizations (Lee et al, 2014; Gharibvand
et al., 2013). Again, the competitive nature of the
semiconductor industry demands the right lead-
ership style to effectively manage the employees
to engage in innovative work behaviors (IWB)
that will enhance individual company's com-
petitiveness in the industry. Studies on various
leadership styles, including transformational
(Afsar et al., 2014), servant (Yoshida et al., 2014),
and ethical (Resick et al., 2013) inspire employees
to engage in innovative work behaviors (IWBs).

One leadership style that has emerged and
gained significant attention in the semiconductor
industry is ambidextrous leadership. Ambidex-
trous leadership (AL) is seen as a combination
of transformational and transactional leadership.
Because ambidextrous leadership theory's pri-
mary objective is to promote innovation at the
individual, team, and organizational levels, this
study focused on this concept to examine how
it affects IWB (Zacher and Rosing, 2015; Rosing
et al., 2011). For instance, LS Group in South
Korea uses AL style to ignite IWBs from em-

ployees. This indicates that IWBs must be match-
ed by a similarly multifaceted leadership style
in order to foster an environment where employ-
ees can develop and implement new ideas (Zacher
and Rosing, 2015) which is very important in the
semiconductor industry. Thus, AL style is seen
a leadership type that matches and adapts the
IWBs of its followers.

Prior studies have revealed that leadership style
in the semiconductor industry still remains un-
der-researched or limited in terms of empirical
studies and called for more future studies in differ-
ent countries (Lee et al., 2014; Gharibvand et al.,
2013). However, none of the previous studies on
leadership focused on AL in the semiconductor
industry. This gap in the literature requires re-
search attention to identify how AL play a critical
role in the semiconductor industry in their quest
to generate IWBs from employees. In addition,
a study revealed that ambidextrous leaders are
more effective at evoking IWB in both individuals
and teams when they can act in both opening
(i.e., exploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation)
behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011). Most of the pre-
vious studies tested the direct relationship among
different leadership styles and IWB (Afsar et al.,
2014; Resick et al., 2013) but did not extensively
analyze the indirect processes through which AL
affects IWB. This lacuna in the literature needs
to be addressed. Moreover, the prior studies did
not fully analyze the complex mechanisms and
circumstances/conditions under which AL influ-
ences IWB in organizations (Runhaar et al, 2010).

Therefore, to address the shortcoming of the
previous studies, the present study fills the gap
in the literature by building on the AL theory
and social exchange theory (SET) to assess the
direct effect of ambidextrous leadership on IWB

in the semiconductor industry in Korea. In addi-
tion, the study seeks to examine the indirect effect
of decision-making autonomy (DMA) and work-
place learning (WL) in the relationship between
AL and IWB. Moreover, the study investigates
the moderating role of employees' resistance to
change (RC) in the relationship between AL and
WL and further investigates the moderating role
of employees' openness to experience (OE) in the
direct relationship between AL and IWB. The
outcome of the study expands the scope of AL
in the ever-important semiconductor industry
and magnifies its contribution to the Korean
context.

# 2. Theoretical Background

2.1 South Korea's Semiconductor Industry

South Korea has emerged as a leading player
in the semiconductor industry, with companies
such as Samsung, SK Hynix, LG Electronics and
Hyundai Electronics dominating the global market.
The industry has played a significant role in the
country's economic growth, accounting for a large
portion of its exports and providing high-paying
jobs for skilled workers. Data available indicates
that the semiconductor industry, with its high
capital and technology intensity, is currently the
main engine of South Korea's economic growth.
As of 2020, Korea held an 18.4% share of the
worldwide semiconductor market, maintaining its
second-place position since 2013. With DRAM
making up 71.1% and NAND accounting for 44.9%
of the worldwide memory chip market, Korea
in particular held 56.9% of the market (OMDIA,
2021). The value of South Korea's semiconductor
production was estimated to be over 158.7 trillion

South Korean won in 2020 (Kim et al., 2022).
According to data from the Korea Semiconductor
Industry Association (KSIA), South Korea's
semiconductor exports reached a record high of
$101.5 billion in 2021, up 30.4% from the previous
year. The industry has been boosted by strong
demand for memory chips, particularly from data
centers and the gaming industry.

The country's success in this industry can be
attributed to a number of factors, including strong
government support, a highly educated work-
force, and a culture of innovation. For instance,
South Korea is investing in the development of
next-generation semiconductor technologies
such as artificial intelligence (AI) chips, quantum
computing and 5G. The South Korean govern-
ment has announced plans to invest 510 trillion
won ($450 billion) in the semiconductor industry
over the next decade to maintain its competitive-
ness and lead the global market. Additionally,
semiconductor manufacturers in Korea are inves-
ting heavily in new facilities and technology. For
example, Samsung Electronics announced in May
2021 that it would invest $151 billion over the
next decade to strengthen its semiconductor and
biopharmaceutical businesses. The industry has
educated workforce and employs over 190,000
people and contributes about 20% of the country's
total manufacturing output (KSIA, 2020).

However, in recent years, the South Korean
semiconductor industry is also subject to intense
competition and faces challenges due to the
US-China trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, in-
creasing manufacturing costs, supply chain dis-
ruptions, etc. Nevertheless, South Korea's semi-
conductor industry is expected to continue to
thrive in the coming years, driven by the increas-
ing demand for advanced technologies and the

country's focus on innovation and technological
development such as 5G, artificial intelligence,
and the internet of things (IoT) to drive growth
in the future.

2.2 Ambidextrous leadership Theory

Ambidextrous leadership (AL) theory is a con-
cept that focuses on the ability of leaders to bal-
ance innovation and efficiency in their organiza-
tions. One of the earliest stud ies on AL was
conducted by Robert Duncan in 1976. Duncan ar-
gued that organizations must be able to balance
exploration (creating new knowledge) and ex-
ploitation (applying existing knowledge) to re-
main competitive. Since then, numerous studies
have investigated the concept of AL. O'Reilly and
Tushman (2004) developed a framework for AL
that identified three key components: structural,
contextual, and leadership. Structural ambi-
dexterity refers to the ability of organizations
to manage separate units that focus on exploration
and exploitation. Contextual ambidexterity refers
to the ability of leaders to create an environment
that supports both exploration and exploitation.
Finally, leadership ambidexterity refers to the
ability of leaders to balance both exploration and
exploitation within their own role (O'Reilly and
Tushman, 2004).

A recent meta - analytical study by Rosing et
al. revealed that no particular leadership style
was consistently related to employee innovation
behaviors (Zacher and Rosing, 2015). As such,
they introduced the AL model, which specifically
describes two types of leader behaviors - opening
and closing - to consider IWB's (Rosing et al.,
2011). Grounded on their understanding of the
significance of ambidexterity to innovation lead-

ership, they proposed AL theory, suggesting that
to foster employee innovation behaviors, leaders
need to demonstrate and flexibly switch between
opening and closing leadership behaviors, in-
tended at increasing and decreasing variance in
employee behaviors respectively. Opening lead-
ership behaviors inspire employees to engage in
explorative innovation such as allowing errors
and encouraging error learning, motivating them
to take risk and challenging them to think outside
the box. Closing leadership behaviors motivate
employees to engage in exploitation innovation
behaviors such as setting guidelines, sanctioning
errors, monitoring and taking corrective action,
etc. This study focuses and builds our arguments
based on the AL approach by Rosing et al. (2011).

The literature on AL theory suggests that it
is an important concept for understanding how
leaders can balance the opening behaviors (explo-
ration of new ideas) with the closing behaviors
(exploitation of existing ones). Leaders who are
able to balance exploration and exploitation are
better able to adapt to changing market conditions
and create new products and services. This ap-
proach to leadership can help organizations foster
innovation, long-term growth and performance.

3.2 Development of Research Hypotheses

3.2.1 Ambidextrous Leadership and
Innovative Work Behavior

Ambidextrous leadership (AL) refers to the
ability to foster both explorative and exploitative
behaviors in followers by increasing or reducing
variance in their behavior and flexible switching
between those behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011).
One outcome of ambidextrous leadership in or-
ganizations is innovative work behavior (IWB).
IWB refers to the individual behavior directed
toward the initiation and intentional introduction
of new and useful ideas, processes, products, or
procedures within a work role, group or organ-
ization (De Jong and Den Hartog, 2007). The two
phases of IWB (idea generation and imple-
mentation) cover many tasks (i.e., exploration &
exploitation) which seeks to improve innovation

and performance of organizations. With the right
organizational and job resources, particularly in
terms of leadership, the IWB can be promoted
(Matthew, 2009).

Some leadership behaviors are viewed by lead-
ership theorists as the most important predictor
of creativity and innovation in organizations
(Zacher and Wilden, 2014). Some empirical studies
have demonstrated that leadership styles are pos-
itively related to innovative behaviors (Yoshida
et al., 2014; Gumusluoglu and Ilsev, 2009). In addi-
tion, prior studies have suggested that leaders
who could fit into place in both openings (i.e.,
exploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation) behav-
iors are more influential in terms of arousing IWB
among individuals and teams (Rosing et al., 2011).
In a study, it was found that AL positively influ-
enced innovation performance in Chinese firms
(Xie et al., 2020).

We argue that AL encourage IWB in semi-
conductor industry because AL may depend on
the type of industry or market that the organ-
ization operates in (Gibson and Birkinshow,
2004). The competitive and innovative nature of
the semiconductor industry requires that leaders
demonstrate opening behaviors (e.g allowing
different ways of accomplishing a task, allowing
errors and encouraging error, motivating to take
risk, etc) and closing behaviors (e.g establishing
routines, sanctioning errors, taking corrective
action, paying attention to uniform task accom-
plishment, etc) to ignite more IWB from
employees. The ability of ambidextrous leaders
to demonstrate both opening and closing behav-
iors at a time or switching between these two
behaviors leads to high IWB. Based on the liter-
ature and reasoning given above, we hypothesize
that:

H1: Ambidextrous leadership positively relates
to employee's innovative work behaviors.

3.2.2 The Mediating Role of

Decision-making Autonomy (DMA)

Providing individuals with a great level of lat-
itude to choose their own paths or make decisions
at work is referred to as decision making autono-
my in organizations (Dornbusch et al., 1985).
According to Carayon and Gurses (2008), DMA
gives a person the freedom to make decisions
without interference from others or compulsion.
This includes the capacity to come up with, organ-
ize, and carry out plans of action based on in-
dividual preferences and judgements. They con-
tended that developing innovation and creativity
within organizations requires DMA.

The way a leader leads has a significant impact
on how freely employees can make decisions at
work. For instance, according to a study, manag-
ers or leaders who are more supportive and partic-
ipative tend to give employees more autonomy
(Parker and Collins, 2010). Some studies have
also shown that transformational leadership is
positively associated with DMA (G�zukara, and
Simsek, 2015). Transformational leaders are more
likely to create a climate of trust, respect, and
open communication, which facilitates DMA
(Bass and Riggio, 2006). In addition, it has been
established that democratic leadership styles are
positively associated with greater DMA (Dorgham
and Al-Mahmoud, 2013). However, autocratic
leadership style was found to be associated with
less autonomy (Dorgham and Al-Mahmoud,
2013).

We argue that in the semiconductor industry,
as a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders
(opening leadership behavior), they provide em-

Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior

7

ployees opportunities for independent thinking
and acting as well as giving room for own ideas.
This provides employees with the sense of au-
tonomy to make decisions on their own and further
exhibit more IWB (Ahearne et al., 2008). Likewise,
jobs that are more complex and require higher
levels of skill and knowledge tend to offer more
DMA to employees (Wu et al., 2015). Based on
the ambidexterity theory of leadership for in-
novation (Rosing et al., 2011), we contend that
with the complexity and competitive nature of
the semiconductor industry, AL offers workers
the DMA to use their knowledge, skills and abil-
ities to make high-quality decisions which im-
prove IWB. In addition, the social exchange theory
emphasize that good deeds should be reciprocated
(Blau, 2017). Therefore, we argue that, employees
see AL as one of the best leadership styles that
provides them with DMA. Compared to other
leadership styles (e.g autocratic leadership) that
restricts DMA, employees will psychologically
interpret DMA under AL as a benefit they have
received from the company. As such, they feel
obligated to reciprocate such benefit by exhibiting
more IWB. Grounded in the above discussion,
we hypothesize that:

H2: Decision-making autonomy mediates the re-
lationship between ambidextrous leadership
and innovative work behavior.

3.2.3 The Mediating Role of Workplace
Learning (WL)

W orkplace learning (WL) is the formal or in-
formal acquisition of knowledge or skills that
takes place at a job (Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006).
Formal training programs, on - the-job training,
coaching and mentoring, job rotations, and com-

munities of practice are just a few examples of
the many diverse ways that WL can take place.
Businesses must take into consideration, the na-
ture of work, the skills and knowledge required,
and the preferences of learners whenever they
decide to choose any type of workplace learning.

Some prior studies have identified some factors
that affect workplace learning. For instance, a
study by Huang (2021) revealed that personal
factors (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation and learn-
ing styles), environmental factors (e.g., global-
ization, technology and changes in nature of
work), and organizational factors (e.g., leadership,
organizational culture and support for learning)
all influence WL. According to Zhang et al. (2019),
AL positively influence team learning and team
learning also influences team performance. At
the individual level, Jansen et al. (2016) estab-
lished that AL positively influence individual
learning and which in turn positively influences
organizational learning. The effects of AL on WL
and innovation in the setting of Chinese firms
was examined by Yang et al. (2021). The re-
searchers found that AL positively influences WL
and this in turn positively impacts innovation
performance. Notable range of elements including
organizational culture, individual personalities
and firm structure, may affect how successful
AL is at encouraging WL. According to a research,
ambidextrous leadership is more effective in or-
ganizations that work in fast -paced and dynamic
industries (like technology), where innovation is
necessary for success (Tushman and O'Reilly,
1996).

We argue that in the semiconductor industry,
as a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders
(opening leadership behavior), they allow errors
and encourage error thinking. In addition, by

8

Henry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang

sanctioning errors (closing leadership behavior),
employees pay attention to uniform task accom-
plishment and learn from their mistakes.
Moreover, ambidextrous leaders foster WL by
creating a culture of learning, encouraging ex-
ploration and exploitation activities, and creating
opportunities for employees to learn from each
other. This can be done through formal training
programs, coaching, mentoring, or informal
knowledge sharing. By encouraging employees
to share knowledge and expertise, ambidextrous
leaders can create a culture of collaboration and
continuous learning (Eesley and Roberts, 2012).
Based on the ambidexterity theory of leadership
for innovation, WL will increase employees desire
to remain in the organization and when such top
talents are retained, they feel motivated to engage
in IWB. Furthermore, WL that occurs as a result
of AL in the company, will be interpreted by work-
ers as a good gesture they have received from
the company. They feel encouraged to repay the
organization by engaging in IWB. Thus, we hy-
pothesize that:

H3: Workplace learning mediates the relationship
between ambidextrous leadership and in-
novative work behavior.

3.2.4 The Moderating Role of Resistance to
Change (RC)

Change is inevitable in any organization as it
is an essential component of growth, innovation
and competitiveness. Change can be either re-
active or proactive and may involve different ele-
ments such as organizational structure, culture,
leadership, policies and procedures, systems and
technology. However, employees' resistance to
change is a major barrier to implementing change

successfully. Resistance to change (RC) is a mul-
ti-dimensional construct that refers to employees'
negative reactions, behaviors and attitudes to-
wards change initiatives (Armenakis and Bedeian,
1999).

In organizations, employees may resist change
for several reasons. First, employees may resist
change because they fear the uncertainty and po-
tential negative outcomes associated with it (Holt
et al., 2007). They may not have a clear under-
standing of the reasons for the change, how it
will affect them or what their role will be in the
new setup. Employees may also resist change
when they feel that such changes can threaten
their sense of control and autonomy over their
work, leading to resistance (Oreg, 2006). They
may feel that their expertise, skills and experience
are undervalued or that they will have less input
into decision - making processes. Likewise, em-
ployees may resist change if they do not trust
the motives or capabilities of the management
team leading the change initiative (Ford et al.,
2008).

Some of the consequences of employees' resist-
ance to change is that, it can lead to decreased
productivity as employees may be less motivated,
engaged and committed to their work (Armenakis
and Harris, 2002). In addition, it can increase costs
for the organization as it may require additional
resources to address employees' concerns, pro-
vide training and support, or manage conflicts
(Choi and Ruona, 2011). Moreover, resistance to
change can lower employee morale and job sat-
isfaction as employees may feel undervalued, dis-
respected or powerless (Armenakis and Harris,
2002).

Previous studies suggest that RC plays an im-
portant role in the relationship between leadership

Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior

style and workplace learning. For instance, prior
research found that transformational leadership
had a positive effect on WL, but this effect was
weaker when employees had a higher level of
resistance to change (Gupta and Pathak, 2022;
Javed et al., 2019; Kim and Beehr, 2017). It was
found that participative leadership had a positive
effect on learning, but this effect was weaker
when employees had a higher level of RC (Kim
and Beehr, 2017). A related study that surveyed
various industries in China found that AL affects
workplace learning, and employee RC moderates
this relationship (Yang et al., 2015).

In this study, we contend that, in the semi-
conductor industry, AL can be an effective strat-
egy for promoting WL, but its effectiveness may
depend on the level of employee RC. As such
when employees' RC is low, the positive relation-
ship between AL and WL is stronger. On the
other hand, when employees' RC is high, the pos-
itive relationship between AL and WL is weaker.
Based on these assertions, we hypothesize that:

H4: Employees resistance to change moderates
the relationship between ambidextrous lead-
ership and workplace learning.

3.2.5 The Moderating Role of Openness to
Experience (OE)

Openness to experience (OE) is one of the "Big
Five" personality traits. According to DeYoung
(2015), OE is "the extent to which people are
responsive to new and diverse experiences, in-
cluding artistic, intellectual, and sensory experi-
ences, and the extent to which they seek out and
engage with such experiences." Further, DeYoung
(2015) stressed that those with high openness
scores are frequently curious, innovative, and cre-

ative individuals who enjoy discovering new
things. They are more likely to question estab-
lished views and values and have a propensity
for unusual and abstract thinking. Conversely,
those with low openness tend to be more conven-
tional and prefer tried and-true concepts and
practices. They could be less likely to seek out
novel experiences or challenge accepted stand-
ards since they feel more at ease with the known
and the familiar. It has been suggested that in-
dividuals who are high in OE are more likely
to engage in innovative behaviors (De Dreu, 2006)
and are more receptive to change and new ideas
(Gupta and Krishnan, 2004).

Literature suggests that the relationship be-
tween leadership styles and IWB has been wide-
ly studied in organizational research. However,
inconsistent results have been obtained due to
the lack of focus on how individual variations,
such as OE's, can moderate this association. As
a result, when analyzing the relationship be-
tween leadership styles and IWB, it's crucial to
take into account the importance of OE. A study
found that OE moderated the relationship be-
tween participative leadership and IWB (Hirst et
al., 2009). Some studies revealed that trans-
formational leadership had a stronger positive
impact on IWB for employees who were high in
OE (Karwowski, 2019; Gong et al., 2009; Shin
and Zhou, 2007). Likewise, it was established
that authentic leadership had a stronger positive
impact on IWB for employees who were high in
OE (Bai et al., 2022).

On the other hand, some studies have reported
conflicting findings. For example, Wang and Zhu
(2011) found that the relationship between trans-
formational leadership and IWB was stronger for
employees who were low in OE. Similarly, a study

10

Henry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang

conducted by Zhang and Bartol (2010), found that
transactional leadership had a weaker positive
impact on IWB for employees who were high
in OE. It was established that OE did not moderate
the relationship between transformational leader-
ship and creative performance (Shin and Zhou,
2007).

We argue that, in the semiconductor industry,
employees' OE will moderate the relationship be-
tween AL and IWB. Specifically, employees who
are high in OE may be more receptive to the
exploratory approach to innovation favored by
ambidextrous leaders. They may be more willing
to take risks, experiment with new ideas, and
explore new opportunities. On the other hand,
employees who are low in OE may be more com-
fortable with the exploitative approach to in-
novation favored by traditional leaders. They may
be more focused on optimizing existing processes
and products, and less willing to take risks or
explore new ideas. Therefore, the effectiveness
of AL in promoting IWB will depend on the level
of OE of the employees. Based on these argu-
ments, we hypothesize that:

H5: Employees openness to experience moderates
the relationship between ambidextrous lead-
ership and innovative work behavior.

# 4. Empirical Analysis

4.1 Data Collection and Analysis Method

The semiconductor industry in Korea employs
over 190,000 people (KSIA, 2020). The current
study purposively selected employees of semi-
conductor companies operating in Korea. A pur-
posive sample is one whose features have been

defined for a specific reason that is relevant to
the study's objectives (Andrade, 2021). The
model was empirically examined using survey
questionnaire data collected from employees of
semiconductor industry in Korea from March 15,
2023 - March 21, 2023. The data was collected
with the assistance of a data gathering company
in Korea called Invight. Sample size of 300 em-
ployees was used for further analysis. This
meets the sample size suggested by extant liter-
ature in undertaking a partial least square equa-
tion model (PLS-SEM) analysis (Ringle et al.,
2015; Hair et al., 2011). Data processing and
analysis were done through the use of both
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS
v24) and SMART PLS-SEM (Version 4.0).
When examining numerous variables and a
large number of items, PLS-SEM helps resolve
sample size issues (Hair et al., 2017). PLS-SEM
can also be employed with more small -scale
samples (Rigdon, 2016).

# 4.2 Questionnaire Composition

The scales measuring the items were obtained
from some previous empirical studies. To meas-
ure the attitude and opinion of the respondents
on the concepts under the study, the participants
responded to all items using a 5-point Likert
scale, that ranges from "1 = strongly disagree"
" The scales were vetted
to "5 = strongly agree.
to validate their applicability in the context of
the study before they were used for the data
collection.

Ambidextrous leadership (AL): To measure
AL, the researchers adopted 14 items by (Rosing
et al., 2011). The items comprise of opening and
closing leadership behaviors. Sample items of the

Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior

11

scale are "The leader allows different ways of
accomplishing a task," "The leader reasons to
take risks," and "The leader encourages error
learning."

Innovative work behavior (IWB): A scale was
adopted to measure IWB from De Jong and Den
Hartog (2010). A total of 10 items were used in
the study. Sample items of the scale are "I gen-
erate original solutions for problems, "I attempt
to convince people to support an innovative
idea, " and "I contribute to the implementation of
new ideas. "

Decision making autonomy (DMA): To eval-
uate DMA, the current investigation adapted the
DMA Scale consisting of 9 items established by
Morgeson (2006). Sample items include: "The job
allows me to make my own decisions about how
to schedule my work, " and "The job allows me
to make decisions about what methods I use to
complete my work."

W orkplace learning (WL): The scale for WL
was adopted from Fontana et al. (2015), which
comprised of 11 items. Sample items of the scale
are "I acquire new information at my workplace,"
"The leader reasons to take risks, " and "I ask
colleagues for advice."

Resistance to change (RC): A scale was adapted
to measure RC from Kim et al. (2022). A total
of 4 items were used in the study. Sample items
of the scale are "Changing the organizational sys-
tem seems like a hassle to me, " and "If my com-
pany changes the organizational system, I would
resist it even if I think the change may ultimately
"
benefit me.

Openness to experience (OE): OE was meas-
ured using scale developed by John and
Srivastava (1999). It consists of 10 items. Sample
items include: "I am curious about many different

things," "I prefer work that is exciting," and "I
am ingenious, a deep thinker."

4.3 Sample Characteristics

The demographic information shows that males
represented 81.7% (245) and females represented
18.3% (55) of the sample. Majority of the partic-
ipants 47.3% (142) were between 40-49 years.
Most of the participants 76.0% (228) were gradu-
ates with bachelor degree and 13.0% (39) were
master degree holders. Majority of the re-
spondents 23.7% (71) have worked in the semi-
conductor industry for 16 years and above. About
33.3% (100) of the participants had worked in
their current organization for 5 years or less.
48.3% (145) of the respondents were departmental
head/deputy managers. Most of the respondents
(28.3%) provide management support. The details

# 4.4 Measurement Model Assessment

Following the disjoint two-stage approach
Becker (2012), the measurement model of the low-
er order construct was first assessed by examin-
ing two types of validity: convergent validity and
discriminant validity.

4.4.1 Convergent Validity

The convergent validity is ascertained by ex-
amining the loadings, average variance ex-
tracted (AVE) and the composite reliability (CR)
(Rahman et al., 2015; Gholami et al., 2013). The

loadings were all significant above the cut-off
value 0.50 as suggested by Hair et al. (2017).
<Table 2> shows that the composite reliabilities
were all above the 0.70 threshold (Roldan et al.,
2017) while average variance extracted (AVE)
coefficients met the 0.5 threshold suggesting
adequate convergent validity (Fornell and
Larcker, 1981).

<Table 2> Composite Reliability(CR) & Average
Variance Extracted (AVE)

|  | CR | AVE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLB | 0.881 | 0.517 |
| DMA | 0.935 | 0.616 |
| IWB | 0.938 | 0.601 |
| OE | 0.930 | 0.571 |
| OLB | 0.918 | 0.618 |
| RC | 0.819 | 0.535 |
| WL | 0.928 | 0.54 |


Notes: OLB= Opening Leadership Behavior; CLB =
Closing Leadership Behavior; IWB = Innovative
Work Behavior; DMA = Decision Making
Autonomy; WL = Workplace Learning; RC =
Resistance to Change; OE = Openness to
Experience.

4.4.2 Discriminant Validity

The heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correla-
tions (HTMT) is a relatively and consistently
novel mechanism to assess discriminant val-
idity in SEM (Henseler et al., 2014). In a stricter
method to employ HTMT, a threshold value of
0.85 has been suggested (Hair et al., 2019;
Kline, 2023), while some academic SEM re-
searchers backed a more flexible value of 0.90
(Garson, 2016; Henseler et al., 2015). <Table 3>
shows that our HTMT were within acceptable
threshold.

to Experience.

4.4.3 Validating Higher Order Constructs-
Convergent Validity & Discriminant
Validity

The higher order construct (ambidextrous
leadership) was validated as part of the measure-
ment model assessment. This construct was as-
sessed for reliability and convergent validity. In
addition, as recommended by Kline (2023), the
higher order construct was tested for discriminant
validity with other lower constructs. The results
show that the loadings reliability and convergent
validity of the higher order construct and the other
constructs are acceptable as the value of compo-
site reliability is above 0.70 and the AVE is greater

than 0.50 (see <Table 4>). With regards to dis-
criminant validity, the results of the HTMT (see
<Table 5>) is below the 0.90 threshold (Garson,
2016; Henseler et al., 2015).

<Table 4> Composite Reliability (CR) & Average
Variance Extracted (AVE)

# 4.5 The Structural Model Assessment

The structural model examines the causal con-
nections between a model's latent constructs
(Mumtaz et al., 2017). Researchers must first solve
the collinearity problem in order to prevent any
biases in regression results, and SEM researchers
suggested utilizing VIF - Variance Inflation
Factor to analyze the collinearity (Mumtaz et al.,
2017). Likewise, if all VIFs from a thorough colli-
nearity test are equal to or lower than 3.3, the
model can be said to be free of common method
bias (Kock, 2015). The study was unaffected by
collinearity problems because the VIF values re-
ported for each latent construct in our inves-
tigation were all less than 3.3. In addition, to test
the model fit, we assessed the standardized root
mean square (SRMR). The SRMR value for the
study model is 0.059 less than 0.08 which indicates
a good model fit (Henseler et al., 2013).

4.5.1 Direct Relations

Using 5,000 bootstrap samples and a sample
size of 300 employees, the current study used
the bootstrapping approach to assess the path
coefficients and their significance in accordance
with Hair et al. (2019). First, H1 hypothesized
that AL positively impacts IWB. The results
(<Table 6>) show a positive relationship between
AL and IWB (� = 0.218, t = 3.348, p < 0.00).
Therefore, H1 is supported. The predictive power
of the independent variable was disclosed with
IWB having the largest variance explained
(0.652), followed by WL (0.370), and DMA (0.315).

4.5.2 Specific Indirect Relations

The mediation hypotheses were tested follow-
ing the approach used by (Nitzl et al, 2016; Roldan
et al., 2017). In hypotheses 2 & 3, the study pro-
posed that DMA and WL respectively would me-
diate the effect of AL on IWB. <Table 7> shows

that AL has a significant direct effect on IWB.
Furthermore, all the indirect effects of AL on IWB
are significant. The results indicate significant
(p < 0.05) partial mediating roles of DMA (H2:
� = 0.097, t = 2.652, p く 0.05) and WL (H3: B
= 0.192, t = 3.079, p く 0.05). The total effect of
AL on IWB was significant (� = 0.507, t = 7.944,
p = 0.000). With the inclusion of the mediators
the direct effect was still significant (B = 0.218,
t = 3.348, p = 0.000). Hence, DMA and WL partially
mediated the relationship between AL and IWB.
The results provide strong support for hypotheses
2 & 3.

# 4.5.3 Moderating Effects

The hypothesis (H4) sought to ascertain the
moderating role of resistance to change (RC) in
the relationship between AL and WL. The results
revealed that RC moderated the relationship be-
tween AL and WL as it was significant (B=0.035,

t=1.822, p=0.034). The moderation results indicate
that RC interacts with AL and WL. The simple
slope shows that beyond the point of interaction,
RC is positively interacting with itself and that
of AL and WL. In addition, it reveals that when
RC is low, the relationship between AL and WL
will be stronger than when RC is high. Hence,
our hypothesis (H4) was supported. [Figure 2]
shows the simple slope analysis. However, our
hypothesis 5, which predicted that OE will moder-
ate the relationship between AL and IWB was
not supported.

4.5.4 Post-hoc Analysis

In our post-hoc analysis, we conducted mul-
ti-group analysis and observed that the 3 criteria
or test for multi-group analysis (MGA, para-
metric test, and Welch-Satterthwait test) were
all significant because P-values were less than
0.05. In addition, we established that there is a
moderating effect or significant differences.
Specifically, there is a significant variation be-
tween young and old-aged employees in terms
of the effect of DMA on IWB. Again, we observed
the significant variations between employees in
low and high ranked positions in terms of their
effect on AL and DMA. The results are summar-
ized in <Table 9>.

We assessed the bootstrapping results for
further analysis. The bootstrapping results in
Table 10 revealed that although age has sig-
nificant impact on DMA → IWB, old aged em-
ployees have strong and significant impact than
young aged employees. This can be attributed
to the fact that, old aged employees in the
Korean semiconductor industry have a lot of
work experience than the young employees. As
such, compared to the young employees, the old
aged employees have high sense of judgment to
make decisions on their own, take personal ini-
tiative, and enjoy considerable independence and
freedom which enable them to generate original

solutions for problems and as well introduce in-
novative ideas which reflect IWB. As such, our
results reveal that in the Korean context, old
aged employees in the semiconductor industry
have higher IWB than young employees. This
finding of our study is supported by Stoffers et
al. (2018), who also found that old aged employ-
ees have stronger influence on IWB than young
employees in small and medium-sized enter-
prises in Netherland.

Likewise, the bootstrapping results show that
although position/rank has significant positive
impact on AL → DMA, employees in high ranked
positions (e.g departmental heads and executive
officers) have strong and significant impact than
employees in low ranked positons (e.g junior
staff/assistant manager). This shows that in a
semiconductor business with AL, workers in high
ranked positions possess more DMA than work-
ers in low ranked positions. This is also a reflection
of the Korean work culture which gives more
DMA to people in higher position (seniority).
Moreover, we observed that although there was
no moderation effect for gender in terms of the
AL → IWB relationship, females had more sig-
nificant impact than males. This implies that, in
the presence of AL, females contribute more to
IWB than males. The results are summarized in
<Table 10>.

# 5. Discussion, Implications,
Limitations and Conclusion

# 5.1 Discussion

Although prior research has shown mixed re-
sults, leadership is usually regarded as a key pre-
dictor of individual, team, and organizational-
level innovation (Hammond et al., 2011; Rosing
et al., 2011). Using the AL theory of innovation,
this study assessed the impact of AL on IWB
and the indirect effect of AL on IWB through
DMA and WL. In addition, the study investigated
the moderating effect of RC in the relationship
between AL and WL. Moreover, we assessed the
moderating role of OE in the relationship between
AL and IWB.

Our study supported hypothesis 1 which pre-
dicted that AL positively impact IWB. The results
show that the opening and closing leadership be-
haviors of ambidextrous leaders encourage em-
ployees in the semiconductor industry of Korea
to engage in more IWB. This underlines the rele-
vance of ambidextrous leader behaviors (opening

and closing behaviors) in the IWB process of em-
ployees (Zacher et al., 2016; Zacher and Rosing,
2015). When ambidextrous leaders encourage
employees to experiment with new ideas and also
take corrective action, it promotes IWB of
employees.

The results of our study supported hypotheses
2 which predicted the indirect effect of AL on
IWB through DMA. Prior research focused pre-
dominantly on employee traits such as creative
self-efficacy (Gong et al., 2009), identification
with the leader (Wang and Rode, 2010) and crea-
tive identity (Wang and Zhu, 2011) as mediators
between leadership and employee innovation
behaviors. Our study reveals that DMA is an
important mediator between AL and IWB in the
semiconductor industry. For instance, AL behav-
iors such as opening leadership behaviors offer
workers the opportunity to independently think
and act. Such privilege which is considered as
a form of work autonomy, enable workers to think
outside the box to deliver IWBs such as develop-
ment of new products or services that seeks to
benefit their organization. In addition, the AL
theory suggests that a balance between explora-
tion of new ideas and exploitation of existing ones
can be applied according to the situational re-
quirements of creativity and implementation
(Rosing et al., 2011). From the results of our study,
one of the situation requirements that ignite IWB
is the DMA provided to employees by ambidex-
trous leaders.

Hypotheses 3 which was also supported pre-
dicted the indirect effect of AL on IWB through
WL. The application of AL theory encourages
workers to learn on the job (Rosing et al., 2011).
In the semiconductor industry, such positive be-
haviors of ambidextrous leaders ensure that

18

Henry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang

workers learn new skills and approaches on the
job. Workers do not only learn the new skills
they acquire on the job but also generate IWB
that add value to the quality of work in their
companies. Likewise, based on social exchange
theory, workers perceive AL as a good leadership
style that they have received from an organization
which motivates them to learn. This places an
obligation on workers to reciprocate such benefits
by exhibiting IWB which benefits the entire
organization.

Moreover, the moderated mediation (hypothe-
sis 4) of the study was supported. Hypothesis
4 predicted that RC will moderate the relationship
between AL and WL. The interaction reveals that
in the presence of AL, RC is an important moder-
ation condition or factor for WL to be more effec-
tive in generating IWB from workers. As such,
AL can be an effective strategy for promoting
workplace learning, but its effectiveness may de-
pend on the level of employee resistance to change.
Leaders must be aware of employees' resistance
to change and take steps to reduce it in order
to maximize the point of impact of AL on WL.
This has the potential to also foster IWB.

However, hypothesis 5 which predicted that
OE will moderate the relationship between AL
and IWB was not supported. This may be attrib-
uted to the fact that individuals from Western
cultures, such as the United States and Western
Europe (more individualistic cultures) tend to
score higher on measures of openness to experi-
ence compared to individuals from non - Western
cultures, such as East Asia (more collectivistic
cultures) and Africa (Oishi et al., 2013; McCrae
and Costa Jr, 1997). It is also possible that because
of the industry characteristics and the busy work
schedule of employees, they have less time to

engage in IWB. Future research should further
investigate this relationship.

5.2 Implications

5.2.1 Theoretical Implications

This study makes significant contributions to
the field of research on the semiconductor in-
dustry by offering the first concrete evidence of
AL in the industry and by making recom-
mendations for how to best utilize leadership be-
haviors to foster employee IWB. There is a lack
of consensus regarding the best ways to develop
leadership and apply leadership theories in re-
al -world situations (Bagheri, 2017; Iles and
Preece, 2006). We believe that despite the in-
dustry's limited resources, it is vital to examine
ambidextrous leadership in the context of the
semiconductor industry to enable industry play-
ers' deal with the dynamic and competitive nature
of the sector to encourage employee IWB.

In addition, our research offers real empirical
support for the AL theory and for the development
of theories about IWB and leadership in the semi-
conductor sector. This research reveals both the
complexity of the relationship between leadership
behaviors and employee IWB (Oluwafemi, 2020).
As suggested by Rosing et al. (2011), AL theory
is an important concept to help understand how
leaders can balance the opening behaviors
(exploration of new ideas) with the closing behav-
iors (exploitation of existing ones) to foster IWB.
Likewise, our study provided empirical support
and validated the roles of DMA and WL as inter-
mediary mechanisms linking ambidextrous lead-
ership to IWB. Therefore, we extend AL theory
by suggesting DMA and WL as important media-
tors to examine the relationship between AL and

Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior

19

IWB. AL promotes exploration and exploitation
behaviors among subordinates (Rosing et al.,
2011) resulting in their autonomy, learning and
energy, which in turn leads to employee's IWB
(Wallace et al., 2016).

Moreover, our research extends the literature
on AL by replicating the positive relationship of
opening and closing leader behaviors for a Korean
sample as prior studies have been conducted with
samples from Germany (Gerlach et al., 2020), the
USA (Zacher et al., 2016) and Australia (Zacher
and Wilden, 2014; Zacher and Rosing, 2015).
Lastly, the study contributes to the social ex-
change theory (SET) in the context of leadership
and semiconductor industry by emphasizing how
workers consider AL as an important leadership
style received from the company. The AL style
provides workers with DMA and WL. The work-
ers replicate such good gesture by contributing
to IWB which benefits the entire organization.

5.2.2 Practical Implications

First, our research reveals that in the presence
of AL, employees are more likely to engage in
IWB. Since employees respond positively to IWB,
it places a responsibility on ambidextrous leaders
to understand and effectively switch between be-
haviors (OLC & CLB) or a combination of the
two. OLB promotes higher levels of workers ex-
plorative IWB and that CLB is essential to foster
employees exploitative IWB. In addition, leaders
using AL should educate workers on how to react
positively to AL in the work environment to foster
IWB. For instance, ambidextrous leaders can edu-
cate workers on the importance of establishing
routines, allowing errors, and giving room for
employee's novel ideas. Similarly, organizations
should make an investment in developing AL

traits in their leaders to create a work environment
that inspires employees to demonstrate more
IWB.

Likewise, the mediating role of DMA implies
that a continuous harmonious work environment
should be created for employees to have autonomy
to engage in IWB. Moreover, WL in the form
of training, seminars and mentorship should be
encouraged. Furthermore, this study will be bene-
ficial to HR practitioners or managers in their
leadership selection, training and development,
succession planning and performance evaluation
in the context of the semiconductor industry.

5.3 Limitations and Directions for Future Research

The first limitation of our study is that the
results are country and context specific. Although
South Korea is a major player in the global semi-
conductor industry, concentrating on one country
may limit the generalizability of the findings. It
would be beneficial to undertake further research
on the semiconductor industry in other nations
to see how generalizable the current findings are.
Future research could focus on semiconductor
industry in different settings to further validate
the AL theory. Second, data was collected from
employees in the semiconductor industry. This
could result in self-report bias and common meth-
od bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). However, as men-
tioned in the data analysis section, we im-
plemented a number of measures to mitigate the
risks of common method bias, and our findings
from the variance inflation factor (VIF) test in-
dicate that common method variance is not a seri-
ous concern. To increase the likelihood of produc-
ing unbiased ratings, we advise including leaders,
peers, and employees at all levels in future studies.

Third, although we evaluated crucial contextual
factors such as DMA, WL, and RC characteristics
relevant to IWB in the current study, there may
be more contextual and individual antecedents
that require exploration (Zhou et al., 2008). Future
research may examine other possible mediators
(e.g., trust in leadership, & job security), and mod-
erators (e.g., work environment, perceived organ-
izational support, and level of education). Fourth,
some significant variables, such as years of expe-
rience, salary level and employee job position,
could not be controlled for within the parameters
of this research. Future research should focus
on these variables as well as the barriers to em-
ployee IWB that may exist at the individual, firm,
and contextual levels.

# 5.4 Conclusion

The semiconductor industry is one of the im-
portant industries contributing to global develop-
ment. As such, appreciation of how leadership
plays a significant role in the competitive industry
to foster IWB cannot be overlooked. In this study,
drawing on the ambidextrous theory of leadership
and social exchange theory, we have discussed
how IWB of employees in the semiconductor in-
dustry can be fostered by AL style. Additionally,
we have discussed extensively how AL indirectly
influences IWB through DMA and WL. More im-
portantly, we have highlighted how RC play an
important moderating role in the relationship be-
tween AL and WL. The data gathered from em-
ployees in the semiconductor industry in Korea
reveals that AL is critical to ensure IWB. We
believe that the appropriate industry players will
continue to make good use of AL especially in
the work environment to ensure continuous

growth, innovation and success.
