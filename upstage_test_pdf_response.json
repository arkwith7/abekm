This study explores the important issue<br>of how leadership facilitates employee innovative work behaviors in the semiconductor industry. Based on the<br>assumptions of the ambidextrous leadership theory and social exchange theory, we collected data from 300 workers<br>employed in the semiconductor industry2) the mediating effects of workers decision-making autonomy and workplace<br>of South Korea. The study investigated (1) the impact of ambidextrous<br>leadership on innovative work behavior,<br>learning in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work behavior, (3) the moderating role<br>of resistance to change in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and workplace learning, and (4) the<br>moderating role of openness to experience in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work<br>behavior. SmartPLS 4 and SPSS v24 was used to analyze our data. The study revealed that ambidextrous leadership<br>positively influences workers innovative work behavior. In addition, decision-making autonomy and workplace learning<br>partially mediated the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work behavior. Moreover,<br>resistance to change was found to be a significant moderator in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership<br>and workplace learning. Based on these findings, we conclude that ambidextrous leadership is very imperative for<br>semiconductor businesses seeking to foster employee innovative work behaviors.

Introduction</h1>\n<p id='13' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The semiconductor industry is a complicated,<br>cyclical sector with a highly dynamic business<br>climate, where crucial market share and billions<br>of dollars are involved. Semiconductors can be<br>divided into four main categories: micropro-<br>cessors, memory chips, commodity integrated<br>circuits, and complex systems on a chip. The<br>industry has expanded continuously as a result<br>of its connection to daily life, since we now rely<br>increasingly on high-tech gadgets like tablets,<br>smartphones, high-definition LCD televisions,<br>and smart clothes washing machines. The grow-<br>ing demand for high-tech equipment has led to<br>an increase in the use of components including<br>transistors, computer chips, microprocessors, and<br>diodes. As a result, the global semiconductor in-<br>dustry has become very competitive with major<br>industry giants like Samsung, Intel, SK Hynix,<br>Taiwan semiconductor, Qualcomm, Micron,<br>NVIDIA, ASML Holding, Texas instruments, etc<br>playing a pivotal role in the industry. According<br>to data available, the global semiconductor in-<br>dustry's earnings have grown consistently over<br>the past ten years, hitting 550 billion dollars in<br>2021 and this can be attributed to the ongoing<br>introduction of new market drivers and applica-<br>tions which has made it easier for semiconductor<br>exports to rise (Alsop, 2022).</p>\n<br><p id='14' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>South Korea's semiconductor industry is a vital<br>component of the global industry since it is the<br>number 1 memory semiconductor industry in the<br>world and the second largest semiconductor pro-<br>ducing country (OMDIA, 2021). According to a<br>report by Korea Semiconductor Industry Asso-<br>ciation (KSIA), South Korea's semiconductor ex -<br>ports in 2020 were worth $97.9 billion, which ac-</p>\n<br><p id='15' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>counted for about 17.4% of the country's total<br>exports (KSIA, 2020). Currently, the semi-<br>conductor industry is the backbone of the Korean<br>economy and this success story could not have<br>been possible without the right leadership style<br>in the various semiconductor companies. Leader-<br>ship is essential for success in the high-tech semi-<br>conductor industry because it plays a crucial role<br>in assisting industry organizations in fulfilling<br>their missions in a highly competitive and dynam-<br>ic environment. The semiconductor industry has<br>therefore seen explosive expansion in the 20th<br>century, coinciding with significant changes in<br>commercial markets, the form of organizations,<br>and the leadership qualities required for success<br>in those organizations (Lee et al, 2014; Gharibvand<br>et al., 2013). Again, the competitive nature of the<br>semiconductor industry demands the right lead-<br>ership style to effectively manage the employees<br>to engage in innovative work behaviors (IWB)<br>that will enhance individual company's com-<br>petitiveness in the industry. Studies on various<br>leadership styles, including transformational<br>(Afsar et al., 2014), servant (Yoshida et al., 2014),<br>and ethical (Resick et al., 2013) inspire employees<br>to engage in innovative work behaviors (IWBs).</p>\n<br><p id='16' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>One leadership style that has emerged and<br>gained significant attention in the semiconductor<br>industry is ambidextrous leadership. Ambidex-<br>trous leadership (AL) is seen as a combination<br>of transformational and transactional leadership.<br>Because ambidextrous leadership theory's pri-<br>mary objective is to promote innovation at the<br>individual, team, and organizational levels, this<br>study focused on this concept to examine how<br>it affects IWB (Zacher and Rosing, 2015; Rosing<br>et al., 2011). For instance, LS Group in South<br>Korea uses AL style to ignite IWBs from em-</p>\n<header id='17' style='font-size:18px'>Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior</header>\n<br><header id='18' style='font-size:14px'>3</header>\n<p id='19' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>ployees. This indicates that IWBs must be match-<br>ed by a similarly multifaceted leadership style<br>in order to foster an environment where employ-<br>ees can develop and implement new ideas (Zacher<br>and Rosing, 2015) which is very important in the<br>semiconductor industry. Thus, AL style is seen<br>a leadership type that matches and adapts the<br>IWBs of its followers.</p>\n<br><p id='20' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Prior studies have revealed that leadership style<br>in the semiconductor industry still remains un-<br>der-researched or limited in terms of empirical<br>studies and called for more future studies in differ-<br>ent countries (Lee et al., 2014; Gharibvand et al.,<br>2013). However, none of the previous studies on<br>leadership focused on AL in the semiconductor<br>industry. This gap in the literature requires re-<br>search attention to identify how AL play a critical<br>role in the semiconductor industry in their quest<br>to generate IWBs from employees. In addition,<br>a study revealed that ambidextrous leaders are<br>more effective at evoking IWB in both individuals<br>and teams when they can act in both opening<br>(i.e., exploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation)<br>behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011). Most of the pre-<br>vious studies tested the direct relationship among<br>different leadership styles and IWB (Afsar et al.,<br>2014; Resick et al., 2013) but did not extensively<br>analyze the indirect processes through which AL<br>affects IWB. This lacuna in the literature needs<br>to be addressed. Moreover, the prior studies did<br>not fully analyze the complex mechanisms and<br>circumstances/conditions under which AL influ-<br>ences IWB in organizations (Runhaar et al, 2010).</p>\n<br><p id='21' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Therefore, to address the shortcoming of the<br>previous studies, the present study fills the gap<br>in the literature by building on the AL theory<br>and social exchange theory (SET) to assess the<br>direct effect of ambidextrous leadership on IWB</p>\n<br><p id='22' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>in the semiconductor industry in Korea. In addi-<br>tion, the study seeks to examine the indirect effect<br>of decision-making autonomy (DMA) and work-<br>place learning (WL) in the relationship between<br>AL and IWB. Moreover, the study investigates<br>the moderating role of employees' resistance to<br>change (RC) in the relationship between AL and<br>WL and further investigates the moderating role<br>of employees' openness to experience (OE) in the<br>direct relationship between AL and IWB. The<br>outcome of the study expands the scope of AL<br>in the ever-important semiconductor industry<br>and magnifies its contribution to the Korean<br>context.</p>\n<h1 id='23' style='font-size:22px'>2.

The industry has been boosted by strong<br>demand for memory chips, particularly from data<br>centers and the gaming industry.</p>\n<br><p id='29' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The country's success in this industry can be<br>attributed to a number of factors, including strong<br>government support, a highly educated work-<br>force, and a culture of innovation. For instance,<br>South Korea is investing in the development of<br>next-generation semiconductor technologies<br>such as artificial intelligence (AI) chips, quantum<br>computing and 5G. The South Korean govern-<br>ment has announced plans to invest 510 trillion<br>won ($450 billion) in the semiconductor industry<br>over the next decade to maintain its competitive-<br>ness and lead the global market. Additionally,<br>semiconductor manufacturers in Korea are inves-<br>ting heavily in new facilities and technology. For<br>example, Samsung Electronics announced in May<br>2021 that it would invest $151 billion over the<br>next decade to strengthen its semiconductor and<br>biopharmaceutical businesses. The industry has<br>educated workforce and employs over 190,000<br>people and contributes about 20% of the country's<br>total manufacturing output (KSIA, 2020).</p>\n<br><p id='30' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>However, in recent years, the South Korean<br>semiconductor industry is also subject to intense<br>competition and faces challenges due to the<br>US-China trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, in-<br>creasing manufacturing costs, supply chain dis-<br>ruptions, etc. Nevertheless, South Korea's semi-<br>conductor industry is expected to continue to<br>thrive in the coming years, driven by the increas-<br>ing demand for advanced technologies and the</p>\n<br><p id='31' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>country's focus on innovation and technological<br>development such as 5G, artificial intelligence,<br>and the internet of things (IoT) to drive growth<br>in the future.</p>\n<p id='32' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>2.2 Ambidextrous leadership Theory</p>\n<p id='33' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Ambidextrous leadership (AL) theory is a con-<br>cept that focuses on the ability of leaders to bal-<br>ance innovation and efficiency in their organiza-<br>tions. One of the earliest stud ies on AL was<br>conducted by Robert Duncan in 1976. Duncan ar-<br>gued that organizations must be able to balance<br>exploration (creating new knowledge) and ex-<br>ploitation (applying existing knowledge) to re-<br>main competitive. Since then, numerous studies<br>have investigated the concept of AL. O'Reilly and<br>Tushman (2004) developed a framework for AL<br>that identified three key components: structural,<br>contextual, and leadership. Structural ambi-<br>dexterity refers to the ability of organizations<br>to manage separate units that focus on exploration<br>and exploitation. Contextual ambidexterity refers<br>to the ability of leaders to create an environment<br>that supports both exploration and exploitation.<br>Finally, leadership ambidexterity refers to the<br>ability of leaders to balance both exploration and<br>exploitation within their own role (O'Reilly and<br>Tushman, 2004).</p>\n<p id='34' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>A recent meta - analytical study by Rosing et<br>al. revealed that no particular leadership style<br>was consistently related to employee innovation<br>behaviors (Zacher and Rosing, 2015). As such,<br>they introduced the AL model, which specifically<br>describes two types of leader behaviors - opening<br>and closing - to consider IWB's (Rosing et al.,<br>2011).

Opening lead-<br>ership behaviors inspire employees to engage in<br>explorative innovation such as allowing errors<br>and encouraging error learning, motivating them<br>to take risk and challenging them to think outside<br>the box. Closing leadership behaviors motivate<br>employees to engage in exploitation innovation<br>behaviors such as setting guidelines, sanctioning<br>errors, monitoring and taking corrective action,<br>etc. This study focuses and builds our arguments<br>based on the AL approach by Rosing et al. (2011).</p>\n<br><p id='38' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The literature on AL theory suggests that it<br>is an important concept for understanding how<br>leaders can balance the opening behaviors (explo-<br>ration of new ideas) with the closing behaviors<br>(exploitation of existing ones). Leaders who are<br>able to balance exploration and exploitation are<br>better able to adapt to changing market conditions<br>and create new products and services. This ap-<br>proach to leadership can help organizations foster<br>innovation, long-term growth and performance.</p>\n<br><h1 id='39' style='font-size:22px'>3.

Some empirical studies<br>have demonstrated that leadership styles are pos-<br>itively related to innovative behaviors (Yoshida<br>et al., 2014; Gumusluoglu and Ilsev, 2009). In addi-<br>tion, prior studies have suggested that leaders<br>who could fit into place in both openings (i.e.,<br>exploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation) behav-<br>iors are more influential in terms of arousing IWB<br>among individuals and teams (Rosing et al., 2011).<br>In a study, it was found that AL positively influ-<br>enced innovation performance in Chinese firms<br>(Xie et al., 2020).</p>\n<br><p id='51' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>We argue that AL encourage IWB in semi-<br>conductor industry because AL may depend on<br>the type of industry or market that the organ-<br>ization operates in (Gibson and Birkinshow,<br>2004). The competitive and innovative nature of<br>the semiconductor industry requires that leaders<br>demonstrate opening behaviors (e.g allowing<br>different ways of accomplishing a task, allowing<br>errors and encouraging error, motivating to take<br>risk, etc) and closing behaviors (e.g establishing<br>routines, sanctioning errors, taking corrective<br>action, paying attention to uniform task accom-<br>plishment, etc) to ignite more IWB from<br>employees. The ability of ambidextrous leaders<br>to demonstrate both opening and closing behav-<br>iors at a time or switching between these two<br>behaviors leads to high IWB. Based on the liter-<br>ature and reasoning given above, we hypothesize<br>that:</p>\n<br><p id='52' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>H1: Ambidextrous leadership positively relates<br>to employee's innovative work behaviors.</p>\n<p id='53' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>3.2.2 The Mediating Role of</p>\n<br><p id='54' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:22px'>Decision-making Autonomy (DMA)</p>\n<br><p id='55' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Providing individuals with a great level of lat-<br>itude to choose their own paths or make decisions<br>at work is referred to as decision making autono-<br>my in organizations (Dornbusch et al., 1985).<br>According to Carayon and Gurses (2008), DMA<br>gives a person the freedom to make decisions<br>without interference from others or compulsion.<br>This includes the capacity to come up with, organ-<br>ize, and carry out plans of action based on in-<br>dividual preferences and judgements. They con-<br>tended that developing innovation and creativity<br>within organizations requires DMA.</p>\n<br><p id='56' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The way a leader leads has a significant impact<br>on how freely employees can make decisions at<br>work. For instance, according to a study, manag-<br>ers or leaders who are more supportive and partic-<br>ipative tend to give employees more autonomy<br>(Parker and Collins, 2010). Some studies have<br>also shown that transformational leadership is<br>positively associated with DMA (G�zukara, and<br>Simsek, 2015). Transformational leaders are more<br>likely to create a climate of trust, respect, and<br>open communication, which facilitates DMA<br>(Bass and Riggio, 2006). In addition, it has been<br>established that democratic leadership styles are<br>positively associated with greater DMA (Dorgham<br>and Al-Mahmoud, 2013). However, autocratic<br>leadership style was found to be associated with<br>less autonomy (Dorgham and Al-Mahmoud,<br>2013).</p>\n<br><p id='57' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>We argue that in the semiconductor industry,<br>as a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders<br>(opening leadership behavior), they provide em-</p>\n<header id='58' style='font-size:22px'>Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior</header>\n<br><header id='59' style='font-size:14px'>7</header>\n<p id='60' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>ployees opportunities for independent thinking<br>and acting as well as giving room for own ideas.<br>This provides employees with the sense of au-<br>tonomy to make decisions on their own and further<br>exhibit more IWB (Ahearne et al., 2008). Likewise,<br>jobs that are more complex and require higher<br>levels of skill and knowledge tend to offer more<br>DMA to employees (Wu et al., 2015). Based on<br>the ambidexterity theory of leadership for in-<br>novation (Rosing et al., 2011), we contend that<br>with the complexity and competitive nature of<br>the semiconductor industry, AL offers workers<br>the DMA to use their knowledge, skills and abil-<br>ities to make high-quality decisions which im-<br>prove IWB. In addition, the social exchange theory<br>emphasize that good deeds should be reciprocated<br>(Blau, 2017). Therefore, we argue that, employees<br>see AL as one of the best leadership styles that<br>provides them with DMA. Compared to other<br>leadership styles (e.g autocratic leadership) that<br>restricts DMA, employees will psychologically<br>interpret DMA under AL as a benefit they have<br>received from the company. As such, they feel<br>obligated to reciprocate such benefit by exhibiting<br>more IWB.

According to Zhang et al. (2019),<br>AL positively influence team learning and team<br>learning also influences team performance. At<br>the individual level, Jansen et al.

The effects of AL on WL<br>and innovation in the setting of Chinese firms<br>was examined by Yang et al. (2021). The re-<br>searchers found that AL positively influences WL<br>and this in turn positively impacts innovation<br>performance. Notable range of elements including<br>organizational culture, individual personalities<br>and firm structure, may affect how successful<br>AL is at encouraging WL.

By encouraging employees<br>to share knowledge and expertise, ambidextrous<br>leaders can create a culture of collaboration and<br>continuous learning (Eesley and Roberts, 2012).<br>Based on the ambidexterity theory of leadership<br>for innovation, WL will increase employees desire<br>to remain in the organization and when such top<br>talents are retained, they feel motivated to engage<br>in IWB. Furthermore, WL that occurs as a result<br>of AL in the company, will be interpreted by work-<br>ers as a good gesture they have received from<br>the company. They feel encouraged to repay the<br>organization by engaging in IWB. Thus, we hy-<br>pothesize that:</p>\n<p id='70' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>H3: Workplace learning mediates the relationship<br>between ambidextrous leadership and in-<br>novative work behavior.</p>\n<p id='71' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>3.2.4 The Moderating Role of Resistance to<br>Change (RC)</p>\n<br><p id='72' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Change is inevitable in any organization as it<br>is an essential component of growth, innovation<br>and competitiveness. Change can be either re-<br>active or proactive and may involve different ele-<br>ments such as organizational structure, culture,<br>leadership, policies and procedures, systems and<br>technology. However, employees' resistance to<br>change is a major barrier to implementing change</p>\n<br><p id='73' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>successfully. Resistance to change (RC) is a mul-<br>ti-dimensional construct that refers to employees'<br>negative reactions, behaviors and attitudes to-<br>wards change initiatives (Armenakis and Bedeian,<br>1999).</p>\n<br><p id='74' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>In organizations, employees may resist change<br>for several reasons. First, employees may resist<br>change because they fear the uncertainty and po-<br>tential negative outcomes associated with it (Holt<br>et al., 2007). They may not have a clear under-<br>standing of the reasons for the change, how it<br>will affect them or what their role will be in the<br>new setup. Employees may also resist change<br>when they feel that such changes can threaten<br>their sense of control and autonomy over their<br>work, leading to resistance (Oreg, 2006). They<br>may feel that their expertise, skills and experience<br>are undervalued or that they will have less input<br>into decision - making processes. Likewise, em-<br>ployees may resist change if they do not trust<br>the motives or capabilities of the management<br>team leading the change initiative (Ford et al.,<br>2008).</p>\n<br><p id='75' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Some of the consequences of employees' resist-<br>ance to change is that, it can lead to decreased<br>productivity as employees may be less motivated,<br>engaged and committed to their work (Armenakis<br>and Harris, 2002). In addition, it can increase costs<br>for the organization as it may require additional<br>resources to address employees' concerns, pro-<br>vide training and support, or manage conflicts<br>(Choi and Ruona, 2011). Moreover, resistance to<br>change can lower employee morale and job sat-<br>isfaction as employees may feel undervalued, dis-<br>respected or powerless (Armenakis and Harris,<br>2002).</p>\n<br><p id='76' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Previous studies suggest that RC plays an im-<br>portant role in the relationship between leadership</p>\n<header id='77' style='font-size:22px'>Ambidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior</header>\n<br><header id='78' style='font-size:14px'>9</header>\n<p id='79' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>style and workplace learning. For instance, prior<br>research found that transformational leadership<br>had a positive effect on WL, but this effect was<br>weaker when employees had a higher level of<br>resistance to change (Gupta and Pathak, 2022;<br>Javed et al., 2019; Kim and Beehr, 2017). It was<br>found that participative leadership had a positive<br>effect on learning, but this effect was weaker<br>when employees had a higher level of RC (Kim<br>and Beehr, 2017). A related study that surveyed<br>various industries in China found that AL affects<br>workplace learning, and employee RC moderates<br>this relationship (Yang et al., 2015).</p>\n<br><p id='80' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>In this study, we contend that, in the semi-<br>conductor industry, AL can be an effective strat-<br>egy for promoting WL, but its effectiveness may<br>depend on the level of employee RC. As such<br>when employees' RC is low, the positive relation-<br>ship between AL and WL is stronger. On the<br>other hand, when employees' RC is high, the pos-<br>itive relationship between AL and WL is weaker.<br>Based on these assertions, we hypothesize that:</p>\n<p id='81' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>H4: Employees resistance to change moderates<br>the relationship between ambidextrous lead-<br>ership and workplace learning.</p>\n<p id='82' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:22px'>3.2.5 The Moderating Role of Openness to<br>Experience (OE)</p>\n<br><p id='83' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Openness to experience (OE) is one of the \"Big<br>Five\" personality traits. According to DeYoung<br>(2015), OE is \"the extent to which people are<br>responsive to new and diverse experiences, in-<br>cluding artistic, intellectual, and sensory experi-<br>ences, and the extent to which they seek out and<br>engage with such experiences.\" Further, DeYoung<br>(2015) stressed that those with high openness<br>scores are frequently curious, innovative, and cre-</p>\n<br><p id='84' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>ative individuals who enjoy discovering new<br>things. They are more likely to question estab-<br>lished views and values and have a propensity<br>for unusual and abstract thinking. Conversely,<br>those with low openness tend to be more conven-<br>tional and prefer tried and-true concepts and<br>practices. They could be less likely to seek out<br>novel experiences or challenge accepted stand-<br>ards since they feel more at ease with the known<br>and the familiar. It has been suggested that in-<br>dividuals who are high in OE are more likely<br>to engage in innovative behaviors (De Dreu, 2006)<br>and are more receptive to change and new ideas<br>(Gupta and Krishnan, 2004).</p>\n<br><p id='85' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Literature suggests that the relationship be-<br>tween leadership styles and IWB has been wide-<br>ly studied in organizational research. However,<br>inconsistent results have been obtained due to<br>the lack of focus on how individual variations,<br>such as OE's, can moderate this association. As<br>a result, when analyzing the relationship be-<br>tween leadership styles and IWB, it's crucial to<br>take into account the importance of OE. A study<br>found that OE moderated the relationship be-<br>tween participative leadership and IWB (Hirst et<br>al., 2009). Some studies revealed that trans-<br>formational leadership had a stronger positive<br>impact on IWB for employees who were high in<br>OE (Karwowski, 2019; Gong et al., 2009; Shin<br>and Zhou, 2007). Likewise, it was established<br>that authentic leadership had a stronger positive<br>impact on IWB for employees who were high in<br>OE (Bai et al., 2022).</p>\n<br><p id='86' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>On the other hand, some studies have reported<br>conflicting findings. For example, Wang and Zhu<br>(2011) found that the relationship between trans-<br>formational leadership and IWB was stronger for<br>employees who were low in OE. Similarly, a study</p>\n<header id='87' style='font-size:16px'>10</header>\n<br><header id='88' style='font-size:14px'>Henry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang</header>\n<p id='89' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>conducted by Zhang and Bartol (2010), found that<br>transactional leadership had a weaker positive<br>impact on IWB for employees who were high<br>in OE. It was established that OE did not moderate<br>the relationship between transformational leader-<br>ship and creative performance (Shin and Zhou,<br>2007).</p>\n<br><p id='90' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>We argue that, in the semiconductor industry,<br>employees' OE will moderate the relationship be-<br>tween AL and IWB. Specifically, employees who<br>are high in OE may be more receptive to the<br>exploratory approach to innovation favored by<br>ambidextrous leaders. They may be more willing<br>to take risks, experiment with new ideas, and<br>explore new opportunities. On the other hand,<br>employees who are low in OE may be more com-<br>fortable with the exploitative approach to in-<br>novation favored by traditional leaders. They may<br>be more focused on optimizing existing processes<br>and products, and less willing to take risks or<br>explore new ideas. Therefore, the effectiveness<br>of AL in promoting IWB will depend on the level<br>of OE of the employees. Based on these argu-<br>ments, we hypothesize that:</p>\n<p id='91' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>H5: Employees openness to experience moderates<br>the relationship between ambidextrous lead-<br>ership and innovative work behavior.</p>\n<h1 id='92' style='font-size:22px'>4.

The results are summar-<br>ized in <Table 9>.</p>\n<br><p id='167' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>We assessed the bootstrapping results for<br>further analysis. The bootstrapping results in<br>Table 10 revealed that although age has sig-<br>nificant impact on DMA → IWB, old aged em-<br>ployees have strong and significant impact than<br>young aged employees. This can be attributed<br>to the fact that, old aged employees in the<br>Korean semiconductor industry have a lot of<br>work experience than the young employees. As<br>such, compared to the young employees, the old<br>aged employees have high sense of judgment to<br>make decisions on their own, take personal ini-<br>tiative, and enjoy considerable independence and<br>freedom which enable them to generate original</p>\n<br><p id='168' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>solutions for problems and as well introduce in-<br>novative ideas which reflect IWB. As such, our<br>results reveal that in the Korean context, old<br>aged employees in the semiconductor industry<br>have higher IWB than young employees. This<br>finding of our study is supported by Stoffers et<br>al.

This shows that in a<br>semiconductor business with AL, workers in high<br>ranked positions possess more DMA than work-<br>ers in low ranked positions. This is also a reflection<br>of the Korean work culture which gives more<br>DMA to people in higher position (seniority).<br>Moreover, we observed that although there was<br>no moderation effect for gender in terms of the<br>AL → IWB relationship, females had more sig-<br>nificant impact than males.

Using the AL theory of innovation,<br>this study assessed the impact of AL on IWB<br>and the indirect effect of AL on IWB through<br>DMA and WL. In addition, the study investigated<br>the moderating effect of RC in the relationship<br>between AL and WL. Moreover, we assessed the<br>moderating role of OE in the relationship between<br>AL and IWB.</p>\n<br><p id='181' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>Our study supported hypothesis 1 which pre-<br>dicted that AL positively impact IWB. The results<br>show that the opening and closing leadership be-<br>haviors of ambidextrous leaders encourage em-<br>ployees in the semiconductor industry of Korea<br>to engage in more IWB. This underlines the rele-<br>vance of ambidextrous leader behaviors (opening</p>\n<br><p id='182' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>and closing behaviors) in the IWB process of em-<br>ployees (Zacher et al., 2016; Zacher and Rosing,<br>2015). When ambidextrous leaders encourage<br>employees to experiment with new ideas and also<br>take corrective action, it promotes IWB of<br>employees.</p>\n<br><p id='183' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>The results of our study supported hypotheses<br>2 which predicted the indirect effect of AL on<br>IWB through DMA. Prior research focused pre-<br>dominantly on employee traits such as creative<br>self-efficacy (Gong et al., 2009), identification<br>with the leader (Wang and Rode, 2010) and crea-<br>tive identity (Wang and Zhu, 2011) as mediators<br>between leadership and employee innovation<br>behaviors. Our study reveals that DMA is an<br>important mediator between AL and IWB in the<br>semiconductor industry. For instance, AL behav-<br>iors such as opening leadership behaviors offer<br>workers the opportunity to independently think<br>and act. Such privilege which is considered as<br>a form of work autonomy, enable workers to think<br>outside the box to deliver IWBs such as develop-<br>ment of new products or services that seeks to<br>benefit their organization. In addition, the AL<br>theory suggests that a balance between explora-<br>tion of new ideas and exploitation of existing ones<br>can be applied according to the situational re-<br>quirements of creativity and implementation<br>(Rosing et al., 2011). From the results of our study,<br>one of the situation requirements that ignite IWB<br>is the DMA provided to employees by ambidex-<br>trous leaders.</p>\n<br><p id='184' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>Hypotheses 3 which was also supported pre-<br>dicted the indirect effect of AL on IWB through<br>WL.

Workers do not only learn the new skills<br>they acquire on the job but also generate IWB<br>that add value to the quality of work in their<br>companies. Likewise, based on social exchange<br>theory, workers perceive AL as a good leadership<br>style that they have received from an organization<br>which motivates them to learn. This places an<br>obligation on workers to reciprocate such benefits<br>by exhibiting IWB which benefits the entire<br>organization.</p>\n<br><p id='188' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>Moreover, the moderated mediation (hypothe-<br>sis 4) of the study was supported. Hypothesis<br>4 predicted that RC will moderate the relationship<br>between AL and WL. The interaction reveals that<br>in the presence of AL, RC is an important moder-<br>ation condition or factor for WL to be more effec-<br>tive in generating IWB from workers. As such,<br>AL can be an effective strategy for promoting<br>workplace learning, but its effectiveness may de-<br>pend on the level of employee resistance to change.<br>Leaders must be aware of employees' resistance<br>to change and take steps to reduce it in order<br>to maximize the point of impact of AL on WL.<br>This has the potential to also foster IWB.</p>\n<br><p id='189' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>However, hypothesis 5 which predicted that<br>OE will moderate the relationship between AL<br>and IWB was not supported.

It is also possible that because<br>of the industry characteristics and the busy work<br>schedule of employees, they have less time to</p>\n<br><p id='190' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>engage in IWB.

There is a lack<br>of consensus regarding the best ways to develop<br>leadership and apply leadership theories in re-<br>al -world situations (Bagheri, 2017; Iles and<br>Preece, 2006).

AL promotes exploration and exploitation<br>behaviors among subordinates (Rosing et al.,<br>2011) resulting in their autonomy, learning and<br>energy, which in turn leads to employee's IWB<br>(Wallace et al., 2016).</p>\n<br><p id='198' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Moreover, our research extends the literature<br>on AL by replicating the positive relationship of<br>opening and closing leader behaviors for a Korean<br>sample as prior studies have been conducted with<br>samples from Germany (Gerlach et al., 2020), the<br>USA (Zacher et al., 2016) and Australia (Zacher<br>and Wilden, 2014; Zacher and Rosing, 2015).<br>Lastly, the study contributes to the social ex-<br>change theory (SET) in the context of leadership<br>and semiconductor industry by emphasizing how<br>workers consider AL as an important leadership<br>style received from the company. The AL style<br>provides workers with DMA and WL. The work-<br>ers replicate such good gesture by contributing<br>to IWB which benefits the entire organization.</p>\n<p id='199' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>5.2.2 Practical Implications</p>\n<br><p id='200' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>First, our research reveals that in the presence<br>of AL, employees are more likely to engage in<br>IWB. Since employees respond positively to IWB,<br>it places a responsibility on ambidextrous leaders<br>to understand and effectively switch between be-<br>haviors (OLC & CLB) or a combination of the<br>two. OLB promotes higher levels of workers ex-<br>plorative IWB and that CLB is essential to foster<br>employees exploitative IWB. In addition, leaders<br>using AL should educate workers on how to react<br>positively to AL in the work environment to foster<br>IWB. For instance, ambidextrous leaders can edu-<br>cate workers on the importance of establishing<br>routines, allowing errors, and giving room for<br>employee's novel ideas. Similarly, organizations<br>should make an investment in developing AL</p>\n<br><p id='201' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>traits in their leaders to create a work environment<br>that inspires employees to demonstrate more<br>IWB.</p>\n<br><p id='202' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Likewise, the mediating role of DMA implies<br>that a continuous harmonious work environment<br>should be created for employees to have autonomy<br>to engage in IWB. Moreover, WL in the form<br>of training, seminars and mentorship should be<br>encouraged. Furthermore, this study will be bene-<br>ficial to HR practitioners or managers in their<br>leadership selection, training and development,<br>succession planning and performance evaluation<br>in the context of the semiconductor industry.</p>\n<p id='203' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:22px'>5.3 Limitations and Directions for Future Research</p>\n<p id='204' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>The first limitation of our study is that the<br>results are country and context specific.

It<br>would be beneficial to undertake further research<br>on the semiconductor industry in other nations<br>to see how generalizable the current findings are.<br>Future research could focus on semiconductor<br>industry in different settings to further validate<br>the AL theory. Second, data was collected from<br>employees in the semiconductor industry. This<br>could result in self-report bias and common meth-<br>od bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). However, as men-<br>tioned in the data analysis section, we im-<br>plemented a number of measures to mitigate the<br>risks of common method bias, and our findings<br>from the variance inflation factor (VIF) test in-<br>dicate that common method variance is not a seri-<br>ous concern. To increase the likelihood of produc-<br>ing unbiased ratings, we advise including leaders,<br>peers, and employees at all levels in future studies.</p>\n<header id='205' style='font-size:16px'>20</header>\n<br><header id='206' style='font-size:14px'>Henry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang</header>\n<p id='207' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>Third, although we evaluated crucial contextual<br>factors such as DMA, WL, and RC characteristics<br>relevant to IWB in the current study, there may<br>be more contextual and individual antecedents<br>that require exploration (Zhou et al., 2008). Future<br>research may examine other possible mediators<br>(e.g., trust in leadership, & job security), and mod-<br>erators (e.g., work environment, perceived organ-<br>izational support, and level of education). Fourth,<br>some significant variables, such as years of expe-<br>rience, salary level and employee job position,<br>could not be controlled for within the parameters<br>of this research. Future research should focus<br>on these variables as well as the barriers to em-<br>ployee IWB that may exist at the individual, firm,<br>and contextual levels.</p>\n<h1 id='208' style='font-size:18px'>5.4 Conclusion</h1>\n<p id='209' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The semiconductor industry is one of the im-<br>portant industries contributing to global develop-<br>ment. As such, appreciation of how leadership<br>plays a significant role in the competitive industry<br>to foster IWB cannot be overlooked. In this study,<br>drawing on the ambidextrous theory of leadership<br>and social exchange theory, we have discussed<br>how IWB of employees in the semiconductor in-<br>dustry can be fostered by AL style. Additionally,<br>we have discussed extensively how AL indirectly<br>influences IWB through DMA and WL. More im-<br>portantly, we have highlighted how RC play an<br>important moderating role in the relationship be-<br>tween AL and WL. The data gathered from em-<br>ployees in the semiconductor industry in Korea<br>reveals that AL is critical to ensure IWB. We<br>believe that the appropriate industry players will<br>continue to make good use of AL especially in<br>the work environment to ensure continuous</p>\n<br><p id='210' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>growth, innovation and success.</p>\n<p id='211' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>References</p>\n<p id='212' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Afsar, B., Y.F.

Introduction\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a complicated,\ncyclical sector with a highly dynamic business\nclimate, where crucial market share and billions\nof dollars are involved. Semiconductors can be\ndivided into four main categories: micropro-\ncessors, memory chips, commodity integrated\ncircuits, and complex systems on a chip. The\nindustry has expanded continuously as a result\nof its connection to daily life, since we now rely\nincreasingly on high-tech gadgets like tablets,\nsmartphones, high-definition LCD televisions,\nand smart clothes washing machines. The grow-\ning demand for high-tech equipment has led to\nan increase in the use of components including\ntransistors, computer chips, microprocessors, and\ndiodes. As a result, the global semiconductor in-\ndustry has become very competitive with major\nindustry giants like Samsung, Intel, SK Hynix,\nTaiwan semiconductor, Qualcomm, Micron,\nNVIDIA, ASML Holding, Texas instruments, etc\nplaying a pivotal role in the industry. According\nto data available, the global semiconductor in-\ndustry's earnings have grown consistently over\nthe past ten years, hitting 550 billion dollars in\n2021 and this can be attributed to the ongoing\nintroduction of new market drivers and applica-\ntions which has made it easier for semiconductor\nexports to rise (Alsop, 2022).\n\nSouth Korea's semiconductor industry is a vital\ncomponent of the global industry since it is the\nnumber 1 memory semiconductor industry in the\nworld and the second largest semiconductor pro-\nducing country (OMDIA, 2021). According to a\nreport by Korea Semiconductor Industry Asso-\nciation (KSIA), South Korea's semiconductor ex -\nports in 2020 were worth $97.9 billion, which ac-\n\ncounted for about 17.4% of the country's total\nexports (KSIA, 2020). Currently, the semi-\nconductor industry is the backbone of the Korean\neconomy and this success story could not have\nbeen possible without the right leadership style\nin the various semiconductor companies. Leader-\nship is essential for success in the high-tech semi-\nconductor industry because it plays a crucial role\nin assisting industry organizations in fulfilling\ntheir missions in a highly competitive and dynam-\nic environment. The semiconductor industry has\ntherefore seen explosive expansion in the 20th\ncentury, coinciding with significant changes in\ncommercial markets, the form of organizations,\nand the leadership qualities required for success\nin those organizations (Lee et al, 2014; Gharibvand\net al., 2013). Again, the competitive nature of the\nsemiconductor industry demands the right lead-\nership style to effectively manage the employees\nto engage in innovative work behaviors (IWB)\nthat will enhance individual company's com-\npetitiveness in the industry. Studies on various\nleadership styles, including transformational\n(Afsar et al., 2014), servant (Yoshida et al., 2014),\nand ethical (Resick et al., 2013) inspire employees\nto engage in innovative work behaviors (IWBs).\n\nOne leadership style that has emerged and\ngained significant attention in the semiconductor\nindustry is ambidextrous leadership. Ambidex-\ntrous leadership (AL) is seen as a combination\nof transformational and transactional leadership.\nBecause ambidextrous leadership theory's pri-\nmary objective is to promote innovation at the\nindividual, team, and organizational levels, this\nstudy focused on this concept to examine how\nit affects IWB (Zacher and Rosing, 2015; Rosing\net al., 2011). For instance, LS Group in South\nKorea uses AL style to ignite IWBs from em-\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n3\n\nployees. This indicates that IWBs must be match-\ned by a similarly multifaceted leadership style\nin order to foster an environment where employ-\nees can develop and implement new ideas (Zacher\nand Rosing, 2015) which is very important in the\nsemiconductor industry. Thus, AL style is seen\na leadership type that matches and adapts the\nIWBs of its followers.\n\nPrior studies have revealed that leadership style\nin the semiconductor industry still remains un-\nder-researched or limited in terms of empirical\nstudies and called for more future studies in differ-\nent countries (Lee et al., 2014; Gharibvand et al.,\n2013). However, none of the previous studies on\nleadership focused on AL in the semiconductor\nindustry. This gap in the literature requires re-\nsearch attention to identify how AL play a critical\nrole in the semiconductor industry in their quest\nto generate IWBs from employees. In addition,\na study revealed that ambidextrous leaders are\nmore effective at evoking IWB in both individuals\nand teams when they can act in both opening\n(i.e., exploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation)\nbehaviors (Rosing et al., 2011). Most of the pre-\nvious studies tested the direct relationship among\ndifferent leadership styles and IWB (Afsar et al.,\n2014; Resick et al., 2013) but did not extensively\nanalyze the indirect processes through which AL\naffects IWB. This lacuna in the literature needs\nto be addressed. Moreover, the prior studies did\nnot fully analyze the complex mechanisms and\ncircumstances/conditions under which AL influ-\nences IWB in organizations (Runhaar et al, 2010).\n\nTherefore, to address the shortcoming of the\nprevious studies, the present study fills the gap\nin the literature by building on the AL theory\nand social exchange theory (SET) to assess the\ndirect effect of ambidextrous leadership on IWB\n\nin the semiconductor industry in Korea. In addi-\ntion, the study seeks to examine the indirect effect\nof decision-making autonomy (DMA) and work-\nplace learning (WL) in the relationship between\nAL and IWB. Moreover, the study investigates\nthe moderating role of employees' resistance to\nchange (RC) in the relationship between AL and\nWL and further investigates the moderating role\nof employees' openness to experience (OE) in the\ndirect relationship between AL and IWB. The\noutcome of the study expands the scope of AL\nin the ever-important semiconductor industry\nand magnifies its contribution to the Korean\ncontext.\n\n# 2. Theoretical Background\n\n2.1 South Korea's Semiconductor Industry\n\nSouth Korea has emerged as a leading player\nin the semiconductor industry, with companies\nsuch as Samsung, SK Hynix, LG Electronics and\nHyundai Electronics dominating the global market.\nThe industry has played a significant role in the\ncountry's economic growth, accounting for a large\nportion of its exports and providing high-paying\njobs for skilled workers. Data available indicates\nthat the semiconductor industry, with its high\ncapital and technology intensity, is currently the\nmain engine of South Korea's economic growth.\nAs of 2020, Korea held an 18.4% share of the\nworldwide semiconductor market, maintaining its\nsecond-place position since 2013. With DRAM\nmaking up 71.1% and NAND accounting for 44.9%\nof the worldwide memory chip market, Korea\nin particular held 56.9% of the market (OMDIA,\n2021). The value of South Korea's semiconductor\nproduction was estimated to be over 158.7 trillion\n\n4\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\nSouth Korean won in 2020 (Kim et al., 2022).\nAccording to data from the Korea Semiconductor\nIndustry Association (KSIA), South Korea's\nsemiconductor exports reached a record high of\n$101.5 billion in 2021, up 30.4% from the previous\nyear. The industry has been boosted by strong\ndemand for memory chips, particularly from data\ncenters and the gaming industry.\n\nThe country's success in this industry can be\nattributed to a number of factors, including strong\ngovernment support, a highly educated work-\nforce, and a culture of innovation. For instance,\nSouth Korea is investing in the development of\nnext-generation semiconductor technologies\nsuch as artificial intelligence (AI) chips, quantum\ncomputing and 5G. The South Korean govern-\nment has announced plans to invest 510 trillion\nwon ($450 billion) in the semiconductor industry\nover the next decade to maintain its competitive-\nness and lead the global market. Additionally,\nsemiconductor manufacturers in Korea are inves-\nting heavily in new facilities and technology. For\nexample, Samsung Electronics announced in May\n2021 that it would invest $151 billion over the\nnext decade to strengthen its semiconductor and\nbiopharmaceutical businesses. The industry has\neducated workforce and employs over 190,000\npeople and contributes about 20% of the country's\ntotal manufacturing output (KSIA, 2020).\n\nHowever, in recent years, the South Korean\nsemiconductor industry is also subject to intense\ncompetition and faces challenges due to the\nUS-China trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, in-\ncreasing manufacturing costs, supply chain dis-\nruptions, etc. Nevertheless, South Korea's semi-\nconductor industry is expected to continue to\nthrive in the coming years, driven by the increas-\ning demand for advanced technologies and the\n\ncountry's focus on innovation and technological\ndevelopment such as 5G, artificial intelligence,\nand the internet of things (IoT) to drive growth\nin the future.\n\n2.2 Ambidextrous leadership Theory\n\nAmbidextrous leadership (AL) theory is a con-\ncept that focuses on the ability of leaders to bal-\nance innovation and efficiency in their organiza-\ntions. One of the earliest stud ies on AL was\nconducted by Robert Duncan in 1976. Duncan ar-\ngued that organizations must be able to balance\nexploration (creating new knowledge) and ex-\nploitation (applying existing knowledge) to re-\nmain competitive. Since then, numerous studies\nhave investigated the concept of AL. O'Reilly and\nTushman (2004) developed a framework for AL\nthat identified three key components: structural,\ncontextual, and leadership. Structural ambi-\ndexterity refers to the ability of organizations\nto manage separate units that focus on exploration\nand exploitation. Contextual ambidexterity refers\nto the ability of leaders to create an environment\nthat supports both exploration and exploitation.\nFinally, leadership ambidexterity refers to the\nability of leaders to balance both exploration and\nexploitation within their own role (O'Reilly and\nTushman, 2004).\n\nA recent meta - analytical study by Rosing et\nal. revealed that no particular leadership style\nwas consistently related to employee innovation\nbehaviors (Zacher and Rosing, 2015). As such,\nthey introduced the AL model, which specifically\ndescribes two types of leader behaviors - opening\nand closing - to consider IWB's (Rosing et al.,\n2011). Grounded on their understanding of the\nsignificance of ambidexterity to innovation lead-\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n5\n\nership, they proposed AL theory, suggesting that\nto foster employee innovation behaviors, leaders\nneed to demonstrate and flexibly switch between\nopening and closing leadership behaviors, in-\ntended at increasing and decreasing variance in\nemployee behaviors respectively. Opening lead-\nership behaviors inspire employees to engage in\nexplorative innovation such as allowing errors\nand encouraging error learning, motivating them\nto take risk and challenging them to think outside\nthe box. Closing leadership behaviors motivate\nemployees to engage in exploitation innovation\nbehaviors such as setting guidelines, sanctioning\nerrors, monitoring and taking corrective action,\netc. This study focuses and builds our arguments\nbased on the AL approach by Rosing et al. (2011).\n\nThe literature on AL theory suggests that it\nis an important concept for understanding how\nleaders can balance the opening behaviors (explo-\nration of new ideas) with the closing behaviors\n(exploitation of existing ones). Leaders who are\nable to balance exploration and exploitation are\nbetter able to adapt to changing market conditions\nand create new products and services. This ap-\nproach to leadership can help organizations foster\ninnovation, long-term growth and performance.\n\n# 3. Research Method\n\n3.1 Research Model\n\nAn overview of the relationships examined in\nthis study is presented below:\n\n3.2 Development of Research Hypotheses\n\n3.2.1 Ambidextrous Leadership and\nInnovative Work Behavior\n\nAmbidextrous leadership (AL) refers to the\nability to foster both explorative and exploitative\nbehaviors in followers by increasing or reducing\nvariance in their behavior and flexible switching\nbetween those behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011).\nOne outcome of ambidextrous leadership in or-\nganizations is innovative work behavior (IWB).\nIWB refers to the individual behavior directed\ntoward the initiation and intentional introduction\nof new and useful ideas, processes, products, or\nprocedures within a work role, group or organ-\nization (De Jong and Den Hartog, 2007). The two\nphases of IWB (idea generation and imple-\nmentation) cover many tasks (i.e., exploration &\nexploitation) which seeks to improve innovation\n\n![image](/image/placeholder)\nDecision\nMaking\nOpennessto Automomy\nExperience\nH2\nH5\nInnovative\nAmbidextrous H1\nWork\nLeadership\nBehavior\nH4 H3\nResistance to\nChange Workplace\nLearning\n\n[Figure 1] Research Model\n\n6\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\nand performance of organizations. With the right\norganizational and job resources, particularly in\nterms of leadership, the IWB can be promoted\n(Matthew, 2009).\n\nSome leadership behaviors are viewed by lead-\nership theorists as the most important predictor\nof creativity and innovation in organizations\n(Zacher and Wilden, 2014). Some empirical studies\nhave demonstrated that leadership styles are pos-\nitively related to innovative behaviors (Yoshida\net al., 2014; Gumusluoglu and Ilsev, 2009). In addi-\ntion, prior studies have suggested that leaders\nwho could fit into place in both openings (i.e.,\nexploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation) behav-\niors are more influential in terms of arousing IWB\namong individuals and teams (Rosing et al., 2011).\nIn a study, it was found that AL positively influ-\nenced innovation performance in Chinese firms\n(Xie et al., 2020).\n\nWe argue that AL encourage IWB in semi-\nconductor industry because AL may depend on\nthe type of industry or market that the organ-\nization operates in (Gibson and Birkinshow,\n2004). The competitive and innovative nature of\nthe semiconductor industry requires that leaders\ndemonstrate opening behaviors (e.g allowing\ndifferent ways of accomplishing a task, allowing\nerrors and encouraging error, motivating to take\nrisk, etc) and closing behaviors (e.g establishing\nroutines, sanctioning errors, taking corrective\naction, paying attention to uniform task accom-\nplishment, etc) to ignite more IWB from\nemployees. The ability of ambidextrous leaders\nto demonstrate both opening and closing behav-\niors at a time or switching between these two\nbehaviors leads to high IWB. Based on the liter-\nature and reasoning given above, we hypothesize\nthat:\n\nH1: Ambidextrous leadership positively relates\nto employee's innovative work behaviors.\n\n3.2.2 The Mediating Role of\n\nDecision-making Autonomy (DMA)\n\nProviding individuals with a great level of lat-\nitude to choose their own paths or make decisions\nat work is referred to as decision making autono-\nmy in organizations (Dornbusch et al., 1985).\nAccording to Carayon and Gurses (2008), DMA\ngives a person the freedom to make decisions\nwithout interference from others or compulsion.\nThis includes the capacity to come up with, organ-\nize, and carry out plans of action based on in-\ndividual preferences and judgements. They con-\ntended that developing innovation and creativity\nwithin organizations requires DMA.\n\nThe way a leader leads has a significant impact\non how freely employees can make decisions at\nwork. For instance, according to a study, manag-\ners or leaders who are more supportive and partic-\nipative tend to give employees more autonomy\n(Parker and Collins, 2010). Some studies have\nalso shown that transformational leadership is\npositively associated with DMA (G�zukara, and\nSimsek, 2015). Transformational leaders are more\nlikely to create a climate of trust, respect, and\nopen communication, which facilitates DMA\n(Bass and Riggio, 2006). In addition, it has been\nestablished that democratic leadership styles are\npositively associated with greater DMA (Dorgham\nand Al-Mahmoud, 2013). However, autocratic\nleadership style was found to be associated with\nless autonomy (Dorgham and Al-Mahmoud,\n2013).\n\nWe argue that in the semiconductor industry,\nas a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders\n(opening leadership behavior), they provide em-\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n7\n\nployees opportunities for independent thinking\nand acting as well as giving room for own ideas.\nThis provides employees with the sense of au-\ntonomy to make decisions on their own and further\nexhibit more IWB (Ahearne et al., 2008). Likewise,\njobs that are more complex and require higher\nlevels of skill and knowledge tend to offer more\nDMA to employees (Wu et al., 2015). Based on\nthe ambidexterity theory of leadership for in-\nnovation (Rosing et al., 2011), we contend that\nwith the complexity and competitive nature of\nthe semiconductor industry, AL offers workers\nthe DMA to use their knowledge, skills and abil-\nities to make high-quality decisions which im-\nprove IWB. In addition, the social exchange theory\nemphasize that good deeds should be reciprocated\n(Blau, 2017). Therefore, we argue that, employees\nsee AL as one of the best leadership styles that\nprovides them with DMA. Compared to other\nleadership styles (e.g autocratic leadership) that\nrestricts DMA, employees will psychologically\ninterpret DMA under AL as a benefit they have\nreceived from the company. As such, they feel\nobligated to reciprocate such benefit by exhibiting\nmore IWB. Grounded in the above discussion,\nwe hypothesize that:\n\nH2: Decision-making autonomy mediates the re-\nlationship between ambidextrous leadership\nand innovative work behavior.\n\n3.2.3 The Mediating Role of Workplace\nLearning (WL)\n\nW orkplace learning (WL) is the formal or in-\nformal acquisition of knowledge or skills that\ntakes place at a job (Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006).\nFormal training programs, on - the-job training,\ncoaching and mentoring, job rotations, and com-\n\nmunities of practice are just a few examples of\nthe many diverse ways that WL can take place.\nBusinesses must take into consideration, the na-\nture of work, the skills and knowledge required,\nand the preferences of learners whenever they\ndecide to choose any type of workplace learning.\n\nSome prior studies have identified some factors\nthat affect workplace learning. For instance, a\nstudy by Huang (2021) revealed that personal\nfactors (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation and learn-\ning styles), environmental factors (e.g., global-\nization, technology and changes in nature of\nwork), and organizational factors (e.g., leadership,\norganizational culture and support for learning)\nall influence WL. According to Zhang et al. (2019),\nAL positively influence team learning and team\nlearning also influences team performance. At\nthe individual level, Jansen et al. (2016) estab-\nlished that AL positively influence individual\nlearning and which in turn positively influences\norganizational learning. The effects of AL on WL\nand innovation in the setting of Chinese firms\nwas examined by Yang et al. (2021). The re-\nsearchers found that AL positively influences WL\nand this in turn positively impacts innovation\nperformance. Notable range of elements including\norganizational culture, individual personalities\nand firm structure, may affect how successful\nAL is at encouraging WL. According to a research,\nambidextrous leadership is more effective in or-\nganizations that work in fast -paced and dynamic\nindustries (like technology), where innovation is\nnecessary for success (Tushman and O'Reilly,\n1996).\n\nWe argue that in the semiconductor industry,\nas a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders\n(opening leadership behavior), they allow errors\nand encourage error thinking. In addition, by\n\n8\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\nsanctioning errors (closing leadership behavior),\nemployees pay attention to uniform task accom-\nplishment and learn from their mistakes.\nMoreover, ambidextrous leaders foster WL by\ncreating a culture of learning, encouraging ex-\nploration and exploitation activities, and creating\nopportunities for employees to learn from each\nother. This can be done through formal training\nprograms, coaching, mentoring, or informal\nknowledge sharing. By encouraging employees\nto share knowledge and expertise, ambidextrous\nleaders can create a culture of collaboration and\ncontinuous learning (Eesley and Roberts, 2012).\nBased on the ambidexterity theory of leadership\nfor innovation, WL will increase employees desire\nto remain in the organization and when such top\ntalents are retained, they feel motivated to engage\nin IWB. Furthermore, WL that occurs as a result\nof AL in the company, will be interpreted by work-\ners as a good gesture they have received from\nthe company. They feel encouraged to repay the\norganization by engaging in IWB. Thus, we hy-\npothesize that:\n\nH3: Workplace learning mediates the relationship\nbetween ambidextrous leadership and in-\nnovative work behavior.\n\n3.2.4 The Moderating Role of Resistance to\nChange (RC)\n\nChange is inevitable in any organization as it\nis an essential component of growth, innovation\nand competitiveness. Change can be either re-\nactive or proactive and may involve different ele-\nments such as organizational structure, culture,\nleadership, policies and procedures, systems and\ntechnology. However, employees' resistance to\nchange is a major barrier to implementing change\n\nsuccessfully. Resistance to change (RC) is a mul-\nti-dimensional construct that refers to employees'\nnegative reactions, behaviors and attitudes to-\nwards change initiatives (Armenakis and Bedeian,\n1999).\n\nIn organizations, employees may resist change\nfor several reasons. First, employees may resist\nchange because they fear the uncertainty and po-\ntential negative outcomes associated with it (Holt\net al., 2007). They may not have a clear under-\nstanding of the reasons for the change, how it\nwill affect them or what their role will be in the\nnew setup. Employees may also resist change\nwhen they feel that such changes can threaten\ntheir sense of control and autonomy over their\nwork, leading to resistance (Oreg, 2006). They\nmay feel that their expertise, skills and experience\nare undervalued or that they will have less input\ninto decision - making processes. Likewise, em-\nployees may resist change if they do not trust\nthe motives or capabilities of the management\nteam leading the change initiative (Ford et al.,\n2008).\n\nSome of the consequences of employees' resist-\nance to change is that, it can lead to decreased\nproductivity as employees may be less motivated,\nengaged and committed to their work (Armenakis\nand Harris, 2002). In addition, it can increase costs\nfor the organization as it may require additional\nresources to address employees' concerns, pro-\nvide training and support, or manage conflicts\n(Choi and Ruona, 2011). Moreover, resistance to\nchange can lower employee morale and job sat-\nisfaction as employees may feel undervalued, dis-\nrespected or powerless (Armenakis and Harris,\n2002).\n\nPrevious studies suggest that RC plays an im-\nportant role in the relationship between leadership\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n9\n\nstyle and workplace learning. For instance, prior\nresearch found that transformational leadership\nhad a positive effect on WL, but this effect was\nweaker when employees had a higher level of\nresistance to change (Gupta and Pathak, 2022;\nJaved et al., 2019; Kim and Beehr, 2017). It was\nfound that participative leadership had a positive\neffect on learning, but this effect was weaker\nwhen employees had a higher level of RC (Kim\nand Beehr, 2017). A related study that surveyed\nvarious industries in China found that AL affects\nworkplace learning, and employee RC moderates\nthis relationship (Yang et al., 2015).\n\nIn this study, we contend that, in the semi-\nconductor industry, AL can be an effective strat-\negy for promoting WL, but its effectiveness may\ndepend on the level of employee RC. As such\nwhen employees' RC is low, the positive relation-\nship between AL and WL is stronger. On the\nother hand, when employees' RC is high, the pos-\nitive relationship between AL and WL is weaker.\nBased on these assertions, we hypothesize that:\n\nH4: Employees resistance to change moderates\nthe relationship between ambidextrous lead-\nership and workplace learning.\n\n3.2.5 The Moderating Role of Openness to\nExperience (OE)\n\nOpenness to experience (OE) is one of the \"Big\nFive\" personality traits. According to DeYoung\n(2015), OE is \"the extent to which people are\nresponsive to new and diverse experiences, in-\ncluding artistic, intellectual, and sensory experi-\nences, and the extent to which they seek out and\nengage with such experiences.\" Further, DeYoung\n(2015) stressed that those with high openness\nscores are frequently curious, innovative, and cre-\n\native individuals who enjoy discovering new\nthings. They are more likely to question estab-\nlished views and values and have a propensity\nfor unusual and abstract thinking. Conversely,\nthose with low openness tend to be more conven-\ntional and prefer tried and-true concepts and\npractices. They could be less likely to seek out\nnovel experiences or challenge accepted stand-\nards since they feel more at ease with the known\nand the familiar. It has been suggested that in-\ndividuals who are high in OE are more likely\nto engage in innovative behaviors (De Dreu, 2006)\nand are more receptive to change and new ideas\n(Gupta and Krishnan, 2004).\n\nLiterature suggests that the relationship be-\ntween leadership styles and IWB has been wide-\nly studied in organizational research. However,\ninconsistent results have been obtained due to\nthe lack of focus on how individual variations,\nsuch as OE's, can moderate this association. As\na result, when analyzing the relationship be-\ntween leadership styles and IWB, it's crucial to\ntake into account the importance of OE. A study\nfound that OE moderated the relationship be-\ntween participative leadership and IWB (Hirst et\nal., 2009). Some studies revealed that trans-\nformational leadership had a stronger positive\nimpact on IWB for employees who were high in\nOE (Karwowski, 2019; Gong et al., 2009; Shin\nand Zhou, 2007). Likewise, it was established\nthat authentic leadership had a stronger positive\nimpact on IWB for employees who were high in\nOE (Bai et al., 2022).\n\nOn the other hand, some studies have reported\nconflicting findings. For example, Wang and Zhu\n(2011) found that the relationship between trans-\nformational leadership and IWB was stronger for\nemployees who were low in OE. Similarly, a study\n\n10\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\nconducted by Zhang and Bartol (2010), found that\ntransactional leadership had a weaker positive\nimpact on IWB for employees who were high\nin OE. It was established that OE did not moderate\nthe relationship between transformational leader-\nship and creative performance (Shin and Zhou,\n2007).\n\nWe argue that, in the semiconductor industry,\nemployees' OE will moderate the relationship be-\ntween AL and IWB. Specifically, employees who\nare high in OE may be more receptive to the\nexploratory approach to innovation favored by\nambidextrous leaders. They may be more willing\nto take risks, experiment with new ideas, and\nexplore new opportunities. On the other hand,\nemployees who are low in OE may be more com-\nfortable with the exploitative approach to in-\nnovation favored by traditional leaders. They may\nbe more focused on optimizing existing processes\nand products, and less willing to take risks or\nexplore new ideas. Therefore, the effectiveness\nof AL in promoting IWB will depend on the level\nof OE of the employees. Based on these argu-\nments, we hypothesize that:\n\nH5: Employees openness to experience moderates\nthe relationship between ambidextrous lead-\nership and innovative work behavior.\n\n# 4. Empirical Analysis\n\n4.1 Data Collection and Analysis Method\n\nThe semiconductor industry in Korea employs\nover 190,000 people (KSIA, 2020). The current\nstudy purposively selected employees of semi-\nconductor companies operating in Korea. A pur-\nposive sample is one whose features have been\n\ndefined for a specific reason that is relevant to\nthe study's objectives (Andrade, 2021). The\nmodel was empirically examined using survey\nquestionnaire data collected from employees of\nsemiconductor industry in Korea from March 15,\n2023 - March 21, 2023. The data was collected\nwith the assistance of a data gathering company\nin Korea called Invight. Sample size of 300 em-\nployees was used for further analysis. This\nmeets the sample size suggested by extant liter-\nature in undertaking a partial least square equa-\ntion model (PLS-SEM) analysis (Ringle et al.,\n2015; Hair et al., 2011). Data processing and\nanalysis were done through the use of both\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS\nv24) and SMART PLS-SEM (Version 4.0).\nWhen examining numerous variables and a\nlarge number of items, PLS-SEM helps resolve\nsample size issues (Hair et al., 2017). PLS-SEM\ncan also be employed with more small -scale\nsamples (Rigdon, 2016).\n\n# 4.2 Questionnaire Composition\n\nThe scales measuring the items were obtained\nfrom some previous empirical studies. To meas-\nure the attitude and opinion of the respondents\non the concepts under the study, the participants\nresponded to all items using a 5-point Likert\nscale, that ranges from \"1 = strongly disagree\"\n\" The scales were vetted\nto \"5 = strongly agree.\nto validate their applicability in the context of\nthe study before they were used for the data\ncollection.\n\nAmbidextrous leadership (AL): To measure\nAL, the researchers adopted 14 items by (Rosing\net al., 2011). The items comprise of opening and\nclosing leadership behaviors. Sample items of the\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n11\n\nscale are \"The leader allows different ways of\naccomplishing a task,\" \"The leader reasons to\ntake risks,\" and \"The leader encourages error\nlearning.\"\n\nInnovative work behavior (IWB): A scale was\nadopted to measure IWB from De Jong and Den\nHartog (2010). A total of 10 items were used in\nthe study. Sample items of the scale are \"I gen-\nerate original solutions for problems, \"I attempt\nto convince people to support an innovative\nidea, \" and \"I contribute to the implementation of\nnew ideas. \"\n\nDecision making autonomy (DMA): To eval-\nuate DMA, the current investigation adapted the\nDMA Scale consisting of 9 items established by\nMorgeson (2006). Sample items include: \"The job\nallows me to make my own decisions about how\nto schedule my work, \" and \"The job allows me\nto make decisions about what methods I use to\ncomplete my work.\"\n\nW orkplace learning (WL): The scale for WL\nwas adopted from Fontana et al. (2015), which\ncomprised of 11 items. Sample items of the scale\nare \"I acquire new information at my workplace,\"\n\"The leader reasons to take risks, \" and \"I ask\ncolleagues for advice.\"\n\nResistance to change (RC): A scale was adapted\nto measure RC from Kim et al. (2022). A total\nof 4 items were used in the study. Sample items\nof the scale are \"Changing the organizational sys-\ntem seems like a hassle to me, \" and \"If my com-\npany changes the organizational system, I would\nresist it even if I think the change may ultimately\n\"\nbenefit me.\n\nOpenness to experience (OE): OE was meas-\nured using scale developed by John and\nSrivastava (1999). It consists of 10 items. Sample\nitems include: \"I am curious about many different\n\nthings,\" \"I prefer work that is exciting,\" and \"I\nam ingenious, a deep thinker.\"\n\n4.3 Sample Characteristics\n\nThe demographic information shows that males\nrepresented 81.7% (245) and females represented\n18.3% (55) of the sample. Majority of the partic-\nipants 47.3% (142) were between 40-49 years.\nMost of the participants 76.0% (228) were gradu-\nates with bachelor degree and 13.0% (39) were\nmaster degree holders. Majority of the re-\nspondents 23.7% (71) have worked in the semi-\nconductor industry for 16 years and above. About\n33.3% (100) of the participants had worked in\ntheir current organization for 5 years or less.\n48.3% (145) of the respondents were departmental\nhead/deputy managers. Most of the respondents\n(28.3%) provide management support.

The\n\nloadings were all significant above the cut-off\nvalue 0.50 as suggested by Hair et al. (2017).\n<Table 2> shows that the composite reliabilities\nwere all above the 0.70 threshold (Roldan et al.,\n2017) while average variance extracted (AVE)\ncoefficients met the 0.5 threshold suggesting\nadequate convergent validity (Fornell and\nLarcker, 1981).\n\n<Table 2> Composite Reliability(CR) & Average\nVariance Extracted (AVE)\n\n|  | CR | AVE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CLB | 0.881 | 0.517 |\n| DMA | 0.935 | 0.616 |\n| IWB | 0.938 | 0.601 |\n| OE | 0.930 | 0.571 |\n| OLB | 0.918 | 0.618 |\n| RC | 0.819 | 0.535 |\n| WL | 0.928 | 0.54 |\n\n\nNotes: OLB= Opening Leadership Behavior; CLB =\nClosing Leadership Behavior; IWB = Innovative\nWork Behavior; DMA = Decision Making\nAutonomy; WL = Workplace Learning; RC =\nResistance to Change; OE = Openness to\nExperience.\n\n4.4.2 Discriminant Validity\n\nThe heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correla-\ntions (HTMT) is a relatively and consistently\nnovel mechanism to assess discriminant val-\nidity in SEM (Henseler et al., 2014). In a stricter\nmethod to employ HTMT, a threshold value of\n0.85 has been suggested (Hair et al., 2019;\nKline, 2023), while some academic SEM re-\nsearchers backed a more flexible value of 0.90\n(Garson, 2016; Henseler et al., 2015). <Table 3>\nshows that our HTMT were within acceptable\nthreshold.\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n13\n\n<Table 3> HTMT of Lower Order Construct\n\n|  | CLB | DMA | IWB | OE | OLB | RC | WL | RC X CLB | RC X OLB | OE X OLB | OE X CLB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CLB |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| DMA | 0.324 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| IWB | 0.525 | 0.646 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OE | 0.355 | 0.409 | 0.655 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OLB | 0.704 | 0.628 0.312 | 0.651 0.251 | 0.354 0.198 | 0.394 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| RC WL | 0.413 0.52 | 0.631 | 0.766 | 0.561 | 0.629 | 0.269 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| RC X CLB | 0.124 | 0.048 | 0.043 | 0.23 | 0.083 | 0.231 | 0.038 |  |  |  |  |\n| RC X OLB | 0.095 | 0.057 | 0.079 | 0.266 | 0.153 | 0.083 | 0.056 | 0.637 |  |  |  |\n| OE X OLB | 0.189 | 0.094 | 0.069 | 0.05 | 0.141 | 0.263 | 0.112 | 0.065 | 0.062 |  |  |\n| OE X CLB | 0.142 | 0.12 | 0.192 | 0.035 | 0.204 | 0.225 | 0.133 | 0.084 | 0.062 | 0.665 |  |\n\n\nNotes: OLB = Opening Leadership Behavior; CLB = Closing Leadership Behavior; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior;\nDMA = Decision-Making Autonomy; WL = Workplace Learning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE = Openness\nto Experience.\n\n4.4.3 Validating Higher Order Constructs-\nConvergent Validity & Discriminant\nValidity\n\nThe higher order construct (ambidextrous\nleadership) was validated as part of the measure-\nment model assessment. This construct was as-\nsessed for reliability and convergent validity. In\naddition, as recommended by Kline (2023), the\nhigher order construct was tested for discriminant\nvalidity with other lower constructs. The results\nshow that the loadings reliability and convergent\nvalidity of the higher order construct and the other\nconstructs are acceptable as the value of compo-\nsite reliability is above 0.70 and the AVE is greater\n\nthan 0.50 (see <Table 4>). With regards to dis-\ncriminant validity, the results of the HTMT (see\n<Table 5>) is below the 0.90 threshold (Garson,\n2016; Henseler et al., 2015).\n\n<Table 4> Composite Reliability (CR) & Average\nVariance Extracted (AVE)\n\n|  | CR | AVE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DMA | 0.935 | 0.616 |\n| IWB | 0.938 | 0.601 |\n| OE | 0.93 | 0.571 |\n| RC | 0.819 | 0.535 |\n| WL | 0.928 | 0.54 |\n\n\nNotes: IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA\nDecision Making Autonomy; WL = Workplace\nLearning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE =\nOpenness to Experience.\n\n<Table 5> HTMT of Higher Order Constructs\n\n|  | DMA | IWB | OE | RC | WL | OE X AL | RC x AL |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DMA |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| IWB | 0.646 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OE | 0.409 | 0.655 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| RC | 0.312 | 0.251 | 0.198 |  |  |  |  |\n| WL | 0.631 | 0.766 | 0.561 | 0.269 |  |  |  |\n| OE X AL | 0.099 | 0.091 | 0.046 | 0.269 | 0.118 |  |  |\n| RC x AL | 0.057 | 0.075 | 0.273 | 0.085 | 0.055 | 0.031 |  |\n\n\nNotes: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA = Decision-Making Autonomy;\nWL = Workplace Learning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE = Openness to Experience.\n\n14\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\n# 4.5 The Structural Model Assessment\n\nThe structural model examines the causal con-\nnections between a model's latent constructs\n(Mumtaz et al., 2017). Researchers must first solve\nthe collinearity problem in order to prevent any\nbiases in regression results, and SEM researchers\nsuggested utilizing VIF - Variance Inflation\nFactor to analyze the collinearity (Mumtaz et al.,\n2017). Likewise, if all VIFs from a thorough colli-\nnearity test are equal to or lower than 3.3, the\nmodel can be said to be free of common method\nbias (Kock, 2015). The study was unaffected by\ncollinearity problems because the VIF values re-\nported for each latent construct in our inves-\ntigation were all less than 3.3. In addition, to test\nthe model fit, we assessed the standardized root\nmean square (SRMR). The SRMR value for the\nstudy model is 0.059 less than 0.08 which indicates\na good model fit (Henseler et al., 2013).\n\n4.5.1 Direct Relations\n\nUsing 5,000 bootstrap samples and a sample\nsize of 300 employees, the current study used\nthe bootstrapping approach to assess the path\ncoefficients and their significance in accordance\nwith Hair et al. (2019). First, H1 hypothesized\nthat AL positively impacts IWB. The results\n(<Table 6>) show a positive relationship between\nAL and IWB (� = 0.218, t = 3.348, p < 0.00).\nTherefore, H1 is supported. The predictive power\nof the independent variable was disclosed with\nIWB having the largest variance explained\n(0.652), followed by WL (0.370), and DMA (0.315).\n\n4.5.2 Specific Indirect Relations\n\nThe mediation hypotheses were tested follow-\ning the approach used by (Nitzl et al, 2016; Roldan\net al., 2017). In hypotheses 2 & 3, the study pro-\nposed that DMA and WL respectively would me-\ndiate the effect of AL on IWB. <Table 7> shows\n\n<Table 6> Results of Structural Model Assessment for Direct Relation\n\n|  |  |  | Percentile Bootstrap 95% | Percentile Bootstrap 95% | Percentile Bootstrap 95% |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confidence Interval | Confidence Interval | Confidence Interval |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Hypothesis | Coefficient | T-Value | P-Value | Bci LI | Bci UI | F2 | Decision |\n| H1: Al→Iwb | 0.218* | 3.348 | 0.000 | 0.117 | 0.331 | 0.078 | Supported |\n\n\nNotes: AI = Ambidextrous Leadership; Iwb = Innovative Work Behavior; Bci LI = Bias Corrected Interval Lower\nLimit; Bci U1 = Bias Corrected Interval Upper Limit; *P く 0.05\n\n<Table 7> Results of structural model assessment for indirect effects\n\n|  |  |  |  | Percentile Bootstrap 95% | Percentile Bootstrap 95% | Percentile Bootstrap 95% | Percentile Bootstrap 95% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confidence Interval | Confidence Interval | Confidence Interval | Confidence Interval |  |  |  |  |\n| Hypotheses | Relationship | Coefficient | t-value | P-value | BCI LL | BCI UL | Decision |\n| Direct | AL→IWB | 0.218* | 3.348 | 0.000 | 0.117 | 0.331 |  |\n| Indirect | H2: AL→DMA→IWB | 0.097* | 2.652 | 0.004 | 0.040 | 0.160 | Supported |\n|  | H3: AL→WL→IWB | 0.192* | 3.079 | 0.001 | 0.104 | 0.314 | Supported |\n| Total effect | AL→IWB | 0.507* | 7.944 | 0.000 | 0.407 | 0.612 |  |\n\n\nNotes: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA = Decision Making Autonomy;\nWL = Workplace Learning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE = Openness to Experience; BCI LL = Bias Corrected\nInterval Lower Limit; BCI UL = Bias Corrected Interval Upper Limit; *P<0.05.\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n15\n\nthat AL has a significant direct effect on IWB.\nFurthermore, all the indirect effects of AL on IWB\nare significant. The results indicate significant\n(p < 0.05) partial mediating roles of DMA (H2:\n� = 0.097, t = 2.652, p く 0.05) and WL (H3: B\n= 0.192, t = 3.079, p く 0.05). The total effect of\nAL on IWB was significant (� = 0.507, t = 7.944,\np = 0.000). With the inclusion of the mediators\nthe direct effect was still significant (B = 0.218,\nt = 3.348, p = 0.000). Hence, DMA and WL partially\nmediated the relationship between AL and IWB.\nThe results provide strong support for hypotheses\n2 & 3.\n\n# 4.5.3 Moderating Effects\n\nThe hypothesis (H4) sought to ascertain the\nmoderating role of resistance to change (RC) in\nthe relationship between AL and WL. The results\nrevealed that RC moderated the relationship be-\ntween AL and WL as it was significant (B=0.035,\n\nt=1.822, p=0.034). The moderation results indicate\nthat RC interacts with AL and WL. The simple\nslope shows that beyond the point of interaction,\nRC is positively interacting with itself and that\nof AL and WL. In addition, it reveals that when\nRC is low, the relationship between AL and WL\nwill be stronger than when RC is high. Hence,\nour hypothesis (H4) was supported. [Figure 2]\nshows the simple slope analysis. However, our\nhypothesis 5, which predicted that OE will moder-\nate the relationship between AL and IWB was\nnot supported.\n\n![image](/image/placeholder)\n- Chart Title: RC x AL\n- X-Axis: AL\n- Y-Axis: WL\n- Chart Type: line\n|  | RC at -1 SD | RC at Mean | RC at +1 SD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| item_01 | 0.686 | 0.206 | 0.814 |\n\n\n<Table 8> Summary of Results\n\n| Hypothesis No. | Hypothesis Direction | Decision |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hypothesis 1 | AL→IWB | Supported |\n| Hypothesis 2 | AL→DMA→IWB | Supported |\n| Hypothesis 3 | AL→WL→IWB | Supported |\n| Hypothesis 4 | RCxAL→WL | Supported |\n| Hypothesis 5 | OExAL→IWB | Not supported |\n\n\n[Figure 2] Simple Slope Analysis\n\n16\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\n4.5.4 Post-hoc Analysis\n\nIn our post-hoc analysis, we conducted mul-\nti-group analysis and observed that the 3 criteria\nor test for multi-group analysis (MGA, para-\nmetric test, and Welch-Satterthwait test) were\nall significant because P-values were less than\n0.05. In addition, we established that there is a\nmoderating effect or significant differences.\nSpecifically, there is a significant variation be-\ntween young and old-aged employees in terms\nof the effect of DMA on IWB. Again, we observed\nthe significant variations between employees in\nlow and high ranked positions in terms of their\neffect on AL and DMA. The results are summar-\nized in <Table 9>.\n\nWe assessed the bootstrapping results for\nfurther analysis. The bootstrapping results in\nTable 10 revealed that although age has sig-\nnificant impact on DMA → IWB, old aged em-\nployees have strong and significant impact than\nyoung aged employees. This can be attributed\nto the fact that, old aged employees in the\nKorean semiconductor industry have a lot of\nwork experience than the young employees. As\nsuch, compared to the young employees, the old\naged employees have high sense of judgment to\nmake decisions on their own, take personal ini-\ntiative, and enjoy considerable independence and\nfreedom which enable them to generate original\n\nsolutions for problems and as well introduce in-\nnovative ideas which reflect IWB. As such, our\nresults reveal that in the Korean context, old\naged employees in the semiconductor industry\nhave higher IWB than young employees. This\nfinding of our study is supported by Stoffers et\nal. (2018), who also found that old aged employ-\nees have stronger influence on IWB than young\nemployees in small and medium-sized enter-\nprises in Netherland.\n\nLikewise, the bootstrapping results show that\nalthough position/rank has significant positive\nimpact on AL → DMA, employees in high ranked\npositions (e.g departmental heads and executive\nofficers) have strong and significant impact than\nemployees in low ranked positons (e.g junior\nstaff/assistant manager). This shows that in a\nsemiconductor business with AL, workers in high\nranked positions possess more DMA than work-\ners in low ranked positions. This is also a reflection\nof the Korean work culture which gives more\nDMA to people in higher position (seniority).\nMoreover, we observed that although there was\nno moderation effect for gender in terms of the\nAL → IWB relationship, females had more sig-\nnificant impact than males. This implies that, in\nthe presence of AL, females contribute more to\nIWB than males. The results are summarized in\n<Table 10>.\n\n<Table 9> Multi-group Analysis\n\n| Relationship | Difference | MGA P-value | Parametric test P-value | Welch-Satterthwait test P-value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DMA → IWB | (Age_young - Age_old) = -0.222 | 0.023* | 0.036* | 0.023* |\n| AL → DMA | (POS_JA - POS_DE) = -0.138 | 0.045* | 0.048* | 0.050° |\n\n\nNotes: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA = Decision Making Autonomy;\nAge_young = Young aged employees; Age_old = Old aged employees; POS_JA = Junior staff and assistant\nmanagers; POS_DE = Departmental heads and executive officers; *P < 0.05.\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n17\n\n<Table 10> Bootstrapping Results\n\n| Relationship | Original | T- value | P- value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DMA → IWB | Age_young = 0.051 | 0.634 | 0.263 |\n| DMA → IWB | Age_old = 0.273 | 3,566 | 0.000 |\n| AL → DMA | Pos_JA = 0.508 | 7.023 | 0.000 |\n| AL → DMA | Pos_DE = 0.646 | 15.407 | 0.000 |\n| AL → IWB | Male = 0.184 | 2.515 | 0.006 |\n| AL → IWB | Female = 0.324 | 2.199 | 0.014 |\n\n\nNote: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative\nWork Behavior; DMA=Decision Making Autonomy;\nAge_young = Young aged employees; Age_old\n= Old aged employees; POS_JA = Junior staff and\nassistant managers; POS _DE = Departmental\nheads and executive officers.\n\n# 5. Discussion, Implications,\nLimitations and Conclusion\n\n# 5.1 Discussion\n\nAlthough prior research has shown mixed re-\nsults, leadership is usually regarded as a key pre-\ndictor of individual, team, and organizational-\nlevel innovation (Hammond et al., 2011; Rosing\net al., 2011). Using the AL theory of innovation,\nthis study assessed the impact of AL on IWB\nand the indirect effect of AL on IWB through\nDMA and WL. In addition, the study investigated\nthe moderating effect of RC in the relationship\nbetween AL and WL. Moreover, we assessed the\nmoderating role of OE in the relationship between\nAL and IWB.\n\nOur study supported hypothesis 1 which pre-\ndicted that AL positively impact IWB. The results\nshow that the opening and closing leadership be-\nhaviors of ambidextrous leaders encourage em-\nployees in the semiconductor industry of Korea\nto engage in more IWB. This underlines the rele-\nvance of ambidextrous leader behaviors (opening\n\nand closing behaviors) in the IWB process of em-\nployees (Zacher et al., 2016; Zacher and Rosing,\n2015). When ambidextrous leaders encourage\nemployees to experiment with new ideas and also\ntake corrective action, it promotes IWB of\nemployees.\n\nThe results of our study supported hypotheses\n2 which predicted the indirect effect of AL on\nIWB through DMA. Prior research focused pre-\ndominantly on employee traits such as creative\nself-efficacy (Gong et al., 2009), identification\nwith the leader (Wang and Rode, 2010) and crea-\ntive identity (Wang and Zhu, 2011) as mediators\nbetween leadership and employee innovation\nbehaviors. Our study reveals that DMA is an\nimportant mediator between AL and IWB in the\nsemiconductor industry. For instance, AL behav-\niors such as opening leadership behaviors offer\nworkers the opportunity to independently think\nand act. Such privilege which is considered as\na form of work autonomy, enable workers to think\noutside the box to deliver IWBs such as develop-\nment of new products or services that seeks to\nbenefit their organization. In addition, the AL\ntheory suggests that a balance between explora-\ntion of new ideas and exploitation of existing ones\ncan be applied according to the situational re-\nquirements of creativity and implementation\n(Rosing et al., 2011). From the results of our study,\none of the situation requirements that ignite IWB\nis the DMA provided to employees by ambidex-\ntrous leaders.\n\nHypotheses 3 which was also supported pre-\ndicted the indirect effect of AL on IWB through\nWL. The application of AL theory encourages\nworkers to learn on the job (Rosing et al., 2011).\nIn the semiconductor industry, such positive be-\nhaviors of ambidextrous leaders ensure that\n\n18\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\nworkers learn new skills and approaches on the\njob. Workers do not only learn the new skills\nthey acquire on the job but also generate IWB\nthat add value to the quality of work in their\ncompanies. Likewise, based on social exchange\ntheory, workers perceive AL as a good leadership\nstyle that they have received from an organization\nwhich motivates them to learn. This places an\nobligation on workers to reciprocate such benefits\nby exhibiting IWB which benefits the entire\norganization.\n\nMoreover, the moderated mediation (hypothe-\nsis 4) of the study was supported. Hypothesis\n4 predicted that RC will moderate the relationship\nbetween AL and WL. The interaction reveals that\nin the presence of AL, RC is an important moder-\nation condition or factor for WL to be more effec-\ntive in generating IWB from workers. As such,\nAL can be an effective strategy for promoting\nworkplace learning, but its effectiveness may de-\npend on the level of employee resistance to change.\nLeaders must be aware of employees' resistance\nto change and take steps to reduce it in order\nto maximize the point of impact of AL on WL.\nThis has the potential to also foster IWB.\n\nHowever, hypothesis 5 which predicted that\nOE will moderate the relationship between AL\nand IWB was not supported. This may be attrib-\nuted to the fact that individuals from Western\ncultures, such as the United States and Western\nEurope (more individualistic cultures) tend to\nscore higher on measures of openness to experi-\nence compared to individuals from non - Western\ncultures, such as East Asia (more collectivistic\ncultures) and Africa (Oishi et al., 2013; McCrae\nand Costa Jr, 1997). It is also possible that because\nof the industry characteristics and the busy work\nschedule of employees, they have less time to\n\nengage in IWB. Future research should further\ninvestigate this relationship.\n\n5.2 Implications\n\n5.2.1 Theoretical Implications\n\nThis study makes significant contributions to\nthe field of research on the semiconductor in-\ndustry by offering the first concrete evidence of\nAL in the industry and by making recom-\nmendations for how to best utilize leadership be-\nhaviors to foster employee IWB. There is a lack\nof consensus regarding the best ways to develop\nleadership and apply leadership theories in re-\nal -world situations (Bagheri, 2017; Iles and\nPreece, 2006). We believe that despite the in-\ndustry's limited resources, it is vital to examine\nambidextrous leadership in the context of the\nsemiconductor industry to enable industry play-\ners' deal with the dynamic and competitive nature\nof the sector to encourage employee IWB.\n\nIn addition, our research offers real empirical\nsupport for the AL theory and for the development\nof theories about IWB and leadership in the semi-\nconductor sector. This research reveals both the\ncomplexity of the relationship between leadership\nbehaviors and employee IWB (Oluwafemi, 2020).\nAs suggested by Rosing et al. (2011), AL theory\nis an important concept to help understand how\nleaders can balance the opening behaviors\n(exploration of new ideas) with the closing behav-\niors (exploitation of existing ones) to foster IWB.\nLikewise, our study provided empirical support\nand validated the roles of DMA and WL as inter-\nmediary mechanisms linking ambidextrous lead-\nership to IWB. Therefore, we extend AL theory\nby suggesting DMA and WL as important media-\ntors to examine the relationship between AL and\n\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n\n19\n\nIWB. AL promotes exploration and exploitation\nbehaviors among subordinates (Rosing et al.,\n2011) resulting in their autonomy, learning and\nenergy, which in turn leads to employee's IWB\n(Wallace et al., 2016).\n\nMoreover, our research extends the literature\non AL by replicating the positive relationship of\nopening and closing leader behaviors for a Korean\nsample as prior studies have been conducted with\nsamples from Germany (Gerlach et al., 2020), the\nUSA (Zacher et al., 2016) and Australia (Zacher\nand Wilden, 2014; Zacher and Rosing, 2015).\nLastly, the study contributes to the social ex-\nchange theory (SET) in the context of leadership\nand semiconductor industry by emphasizing how\nworkers consider AL as an important leadership\nstyle received from the company. The AL style\nprovides workers with DMA and WL. The work-\ners replicate such good gesture by contributing\nto IWB which benefits the entire organization.\n\n5.2.2 Practical Implications\n\nFirst, our research reveals that in the presence\nof AL, employees are more likely to engage in\nIWB. Since employees respond positively to IWB,\nit places a responsibility on ambidextrous leaders\nto understand and effectively switch between be-\nhaviors (OLC & CLB) or a combination of the\ntwo. OLB promotes higher levels of workers ex-\nplorative IWB and that CLB is essential to foster\nemployees exploitative IWB. In addition, leaders\nusing AL should educate workers on how to react\npositively to AL in the work environment to foster\nIWB. For instance, ambidextrous leaders can edu-\ncate workers on the importance of establishing\nroutines, allowing errors, and giving room for\nemployee's novel ideas. Similarly, organizations\nshould make an investment in developing AL\n\ntraits in their leaders to create a work environment\nthat inspires employees to demonstrate more\nIWB.\n\nLikewise, the mediating role of DMA implies\nthat a continuous harmonious work environment\nshould be created for employees to have autonomy\nto engage in IWB. Moreover, WL in the form\nof training, seminars and mentorship should be\nencouraged. Furthermore, this study will be bene-\nficial to HR practitioners or managers in their\nleadership selection, training and development,\nsuccession planning and performance evaluation\nin the context of the semiconductor industry.\n\n5.3 Limitations and Directions for Future Research\n\nThe first limitation of our study is that the\nresults are country and context specific. Although\nSouth Korea is a major player in the global semi-\nconductor industry, concentrating on one country\nmay limit the generalizability of the findings. It\nwould be beneficial to undertake further research\non the semiconductor industry in other nations\nto see how generalizable the current findings are.\nFuture research could focus on semiconductor\nindustry in different settings to further validate\nthe AL theory. Second, data was collected from\nemployees in the semiconductor industry. This\ncould result in self-report bias and common meth-\nod bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). However, as men-\ntioned in the data analysis section, we im-\nplemented a number of measures to mitigate the\nrisks of common method bias, and our findings\nfrom the variance inflation factor (VIF) test in-\ndicate that common method variance is not a seri-\nous concern. To increase the likelihood of produc-\ning unbiased ratings, we advise including leaders,\npeers, and employees at all levels in future studies.\n\n20\n\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n\nThird, although we evaluated crucial contextual\nfactors such as DMA, WL, and RC characteristics\nrelevant to IWB in the current study, there may\nbe more contextual and individual antecedents\nthat require exploration (Zhou et al., 2008). Future\nresearch may examine other possible mediators\n(e.g., trust in leadership, & job security), and mod-\nerators (e.g., work environment, perceived organ-\nizational support, and level of education). Fourth,\nsome significant variables, such as years of expe-\nrience, salary level and employee job position,\ncould not be controlled for within the parameters\nof this research. Future research should focus\non these variables as well as the barriers to em-\nployee IWB that may exist at the individual, firm,\nand contextual levels.\n\n# 5.4 Conclusion\n\nThe semiconductor industry is one of the im-\nportant industries contributing to global develop-\nment. As such, appreciation of how leadership\nplays a significant role in the competitive industry\nto foster IWB cannot be overlooked. In this study,\ndrawing on the ambidextrous theory of leadership\nand social exchange theory, we have discussed\nhow IWB of employees in the semiconductor in-\ndustry can be fostered by AL style. Additionally,\nwe have discussed extensively how AL indirectly\ninfluences IWB through DMA and WL. More im-\nportantly, we have highlighted how RC play an\nimportant moderating role in the relationship be-\ntween AL and WL. The data gathered from em-\nployees in the semiconductor industry in Korea\nreveals that AL is critical to ensure IWB. We\nbelieve that the appropriate industry players will\ncontinue to make good use of AL especially in\nthe work environment to ensure continuous\n\ngrowth, innovation and success.\n\nReferences\n\nAfsar, B., Y.F.

Introduction\nThe semiconductor industry is a complicated,\ncyclical sector with a highly dynamic business\nclimate, where crucial market share and billions\nof dollars are involved. Semiconductors can be\ndivided into four main categories: micropro-\ncessors, memory chips, commodity integrated\ncircuits, and complex systems on a chip. The\nindustry has expanded continuously as a result\nof its connection to daily life, since we now rely\nincreasingly on high-tech gadgets like tablets,\nsmartphones, high-definition LCD televisions,\nand smart clothes washing machines. The grow-\ning demand for high-tech equipment has led to\nan increase in the use of components including\ntransistors, computer chips, microprocessors, and\ndiodes. As a result, the global semiconductor in-\ndustry has become very competitive with major\nindustry giants like Samsung, Intel, SK Hynix,\nTaiwan semiconductor, Qualcomm, Micron,\nNVIDIA, ASML Holding, Texas instruments, etc\nplaying a pivotal role in the industry. According\nto data available, the global semiconductor in-\ndustry's earnings have grown consistently over\nthe past ten years, hitting 550 billion dollars in\n2021 and this can be attributed to the ongoing\nintroduction of new market drivers and applica-\ntions which has made it easier for semiconductor\nexports to rise (Alsop, 2022).\nSouth Korea's semiconductor industry is a vital\ncomponent of the global industry since it is the\nnumber 1 memory semiconductor industry in the\nworld and the second largest semiconductor pro-\nducing country (OMDIA, 2021). According to a\nreport by Korea Semiconductor Industry Asso-\nciation (KSIA), South Korea's semiconductor ex -\nports in 2020 were worth $97.9 billion, which ac-\ncounted for about 17.4% of the country's total\nexports (KSIA, 2020). Currently, the semi-\nconductor industry is the backbone of the Korean\neconomy and this success story could not have\nbeen possible without the right leadership style\nin the various semiconductor companies. Leader-\nship is essential for success in the high-tech semi-\nconductor industry because it plays a crucial role\nin assisting industry organizations in fulfilling\ntheir missions in a highly competitive and dynam-\nic environment. The semiconductor industry has\ntherefore seen explosive expansion in the 20th\ncentury, coinciding with significant changes in\ncommercial markets, the form of organizations,\nand the leadership qualities required for success\nin those organizations (Lee et al, 2014; Gharibvand\net al., 2013). Again, the competitive nature of the\nsemiconductor industry demands the right lead-\nership style to effectively manage the employees\nto engage in innovative work behaviors (IWB)\nthat will enhance individual company's com-\npetitiveness in the industry. Studies on various\nleadership styles, including transformational\n(Afsar et al., 2014), servant (Yoshida et al., 2014),\nand ethical (Resick et al., 2013) inspire employees\nto engage in innovative work behaviors (IWBs).\nOne leadership style that has emerged and\ngained significant attention in the semiconductor\nindustry is ambidextrous leadership. Ambidex-\ntrous leadership (AL) is seen as a combination\nof transformational and transactional leadership.\nBecause ambidextrous leadership theory's pri-\nmary objective is to promote innovation at the\nindividual, team, and organizational levels, this\nstudy focused on this concept to examine how\nit affects IWB (Zacher and Rosing, 2015; Rosing\net al., 2011). For instance, LS Group in South\nKorea uses AL style to ignite IWBs from em-\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n3\nployees. This indicates that IWBs must be match-\ned by a similarly multifaceted leadership style\nin order to foster an environment where employ-\nees can develop and implement new ideas (Zacher\nand Rosing, 2015) which is very important in the\nsemiconductor industry. Thus, AL style is seen\na leadership type that matches and adapts the\nIWBs of its followers.\nPrior studies have revealed that leadership style\nin the semiconductor industry still remains un-\nder-researched or limited in terms of empirical\nstudies and called for more future studies in differ-\nent countries (Lee et al., 2014; Gharibvand et al.,\n2013). However, none of the previous studies on\nleadership focused on AL in the semiconductor\nindustry. This gap in the literature requires re-\nsearch attention to identify how AL play a critical\nrole in the semiconductor industry in their quest\nto generate IWBs from employees. In addition,\na study revealed that ambidextrous leaders are\nmore effective at evoking IWB in both individuals\nand teams when they can act in both opening\n(i.e., exploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation)\nbehaviors (Rosing et al., 2011). Most of the pre-\nvious studies tested the direct relationship among\ndifferent leadership styles and IWB (Afsar et al.,\n2014; Resick et al., 2013) but did not extensively\nanalyze the indirect processes through which AL\naffects IWB. This lacuna in the literature needs\nto be addressed. Moreover, the prior studies did\nnot fully analyze the complex mechanisms and\ncircumstances/conditions under which AL influ-\nences IWB in organizations (Runhaar et al, 2010).\nTherefore, to address the shortcoming of the\nprevious studies, the present study fills the gap\nin the literature by building on the AL theory\nand social exchange theory (SET) to assess the\ndirect effect of ambidextrous leadership on IWB\nin the semiconductor industry in Korea. In addi-\ntion, the study seeks to examine the indirect effect\nof decision-making autonomy (DMA) and work-\nplace learning (WL) in the relationship between\nAL and IWB. Moreover, the study investigates\nthe moderating role of employees' resistance to\nchange (RC) in the relationship between AL and\nWL and further investigates the moderating role\nof employees' openness to experience (OE) in the\ndirect relationship between AL and IWB. The\noutcome of the study expands the scope of AL\nin the ever-important semiconductor industry\nand magnifies its contribution to the Korean\ncontext.\n2. Theoretical Background\n2.1 South Korea's Semiconductor Industry\nSouth Korea has emerged as a leading player\nin the semiconductor industry, with companies\nsuch as Samsung, SK Hynix, LG Electronics and\nHyundai Electronics dominating the global market.\nThe industry has played a significant role in the\ncountry's economic growth, accounting for a large\nportion of its exports and providing high-paying\njobs for skilled workers. Data available indicates\nthat the semiconductor industry, with its high\ncapital and technology intensity, is currently the\nmain engine of South Korea's economic growth.\nAs of 2020, Korea held an 18.4% share of the\nworldwide semiconductor market, maintaining its\nsecond-place position since 2013. With DRAM\nmaking up 71.1% and NAND accounting for 44.9%\nof the worldwide memory chip market, Korea\nin particular held 56.9% of the market (OMDIA,\n2021). The value of South Korea's semiconductor\nproduction was estimated to be over 158.7 trillion\n4\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nSouth Korean won in 2020 (Kim et al., 2022).\nAccording to data from the Korea Semiconductor\nIndustry Association (KSIA), South Korea's\nsemiconductor exports reached a record high of\n$101.5 billion in 2021, up 30.4% from the previous\nyear. The industry has been boosted by strong\ndemand for memory chips, particularly from data\ncenters and the gaming industry.\nThe country's success in this industry can be\nattributed to a number of factors, including strong\ngovernment support, a highly educated work-\nforce, and a culture of innovation. For instance,\nSouth Korea is investing in the development of\nnext-generation semiconductor technologies\nsuch as artificial intelligence (AI) chips, quantum\ncomputing and 5G. The South Korean govern-\nment has announced plans to invest 510 trillion\nwon ($450 billion) in the semiconductor industry\nover the next decade to maintain its competitive-\nness and lead the global market. Additionally,\nsemiconductor manufacturers in Korea are inves-\nting heavily in new facilities and technology. For\nexample, Samsung Electronics announced in May\n2021 that it would invest $151 billion over the\nnext decade to strengthen its semiconductor and\nbiopharmaceutical businesses. The industry has\neducated workforce and employs over 190,000\npeople and contributes about 20% of the country's\ntotal manufacturing output (KSIA, 2020).\nHowever, in recent years, the South Korean\nsemiconductor industry is also subject to intense\ncompetition and faces challenges due to the\nUS-China trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, in-\ncreasing manufacturing costs, supply chain dis-\nruptions, etc. Nevertheless, South Korea's semi-\nconductor industry is expected to continue to\nthrive in the coming years, driven by the increas-\ning demand for advanced technologies and the\ncountry's focus on innovation and technological\ndevelopment such as 5G, artificial intelligence,\nand the internet of things (IoT) to drive growth\nin the future.\n2.2 Ambidextrous leadership Theory\nAmbidextrous leadership (AL) theory is a con-\ncept that focuses on the ability of leaders to bal-\nance innovation and efficiency in their organiza-\ntions. One of the earliest stud ies on AL was\nconducted by Robert Duncan in 1976. Duncan ar-\ngued that organizations must be able to balance\nexploration (creating new knowledge) and ex-\nploitation (applying existing knowledge) to re-\nmain competitive. Since then, numerous studies\nhave investigated the concept of AL. O'Reilly and\nTushman (2004) developed a framework for AL\nthat identified three key components: structural,\ncontextual, and leadership. Structural ambi-\ndexterity refers to the ability of organizations\nto manage separate units that focus on exploration\nand exploitation. Contextual ambidexterity refers\nto the ability of leaders to create an environment\nthat supports both exploration and exploitation.\nFinally, leadership ambidexterity refers to the\nability of leaders to balance both exploration and\nexploitation within their own role (O'Reilly and\nTushman, 2004).\nA recent meta - analytical study by Rosing et\nal. revealed that no particular leadership style\nwas consistently related to employee innovation\nbehaviors (Zacher and Rosing, 2015). As such,\nthey introduced the AL model, which specifically\ndescribes two types of leader behaviors - opening\nand closing - to consider IWB's (Rosing et al.,\n2011). Grounded on their understanding of the\nsignificance of ambidexterity to innovation lead-\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n5\nership, they proposed AL theory, suggesting that\nto foster employee innovation behaviors, leaders\nneed to demonstrate and flexibly switch between\nopening and closing leadership behaviors, in-\ntended at increasing and decreasing variance in\nemployee behaviors respectively. Opening lead-\nership behaviors inspire employees to engage in\nexplorative innovation such as allowing errors\nand encouraging error learning, motivating them\nto take risk and challenging them to think outside\nthe box. Closing leadership behaviors motivate\nemployees to engage in exploitation innovation\nbehaviors such as setting guidelines, sanctioning\nerrors, monitoring and taking corrective action,\netc. This study focuses and builds our arguments\nbased on the AL approach by Rosing et al. (2011).\nThe literature on AL theory suggests that it\nis an important concept for understanding how\nleaders can balance the opening behaviors (explo-\nration of new ideas) with the closing behaviors\n(exploitation of existing ones). Leaders who are\nable to balance exploration and exploitation are\nbetter able to adapt to changing market conditions\nand create new products and services. This ap-\nproach to leadership can help organizations foster\ninnovation, long-term growth and performance.\n3. Research Method\n3.1 Research Model\nAn overview of the relationships examined in\nthis study is presented below:\n3.2 Development of Research Hypotheses\n3.2.1 Ambidextrous Leadership and\nInnovative Work Behavior\nAmbidextrous leadership (AL) refers to the\nability to foster both explorative and exploitative\nbehaviors in followers by increasing or reducing\nvariance in their behavior and flexible switching\nbetween those behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011).\nOne outcome of ambidextrous leadership in or-\nganizations is innovative work behavior (IWB).\nIWB refers to the individual behavior directed\ntoward the initiation and intentional introduction\nof new and useful ideas, processes, products, or\nprocedures within a work role, group or organ-\nization (De Jong and Den Hartog, 2007). The two\nphases of IWB (idea generation and imple-\nmentation) cover many tasks (i.e., exploration &\nexploitation) which seeks to improve innovation\nDecision\nMaking\nOpennessto Automomy\nExperience\nH2\nH5\nInnovative\nAmbidextrous H1\nWork\nLeadership\nBehavior\nH4 H3\nResistance to\nChange Workplace\nLearning\n[Figure 1] Research Model\n6\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nand performance of organizations. With the right\norganizational and job resources, particularly in\nterms of leadership, the IWB can be promoted\n(Matthew, 2009).\nSome leadership behaviors are viewed by lead-\nership theorists as the most important predictor\nof creativity and innovation in organizations\n(Zacher and Wilden, 2014). Some empirical studies\nhave demonstrated that leadership styles are pos-\nitively related to innovative behaviors (Yoshida\net al., 2014; Gumusluoglu and Ilsev, 2009). In addi-\ntion, prior studies have suggested that leaders\nwho could fit into place in both openings (i.e.,\nexploration) and closing (i.e., exploitation) behav-\niors are more influential in terms of arousing IWB\namong individuals and teams (Rosing et al., 2011).\nIn a study, it was found that AL positively influ-\nenced innovation performance in Chinese firms\n(Xie et al., 2020).\nWe argue that AL encourage IWB in semi-\nconductor industry because AL may depend on\nthe type of industry or market that the organ-\nization operates in (Gibson and Birkinshow,\n2004). The competitive and innovative nature of\nthe semiconductor industry requires that leaders\ndemonstrate opening behaviors (e.g allowing\ndifferent ways of accomplishing a task, allowing\nerrors and encouraging error, motivating to take\nrisk, etc) and closing behaviors (e.g establishing\nroutines, sanctioning errors, taking corrective\naction, paying attention to uniform task accom-\nplishment, etc) to ignite more IWB from\nemployees. The ability of ambidextrous leaders\nto demonstrate both opening and closing behav-\niors at a time or switching between these two\nbehaviors leads to high IWB. Based on the liter-\nature and reasoning given above, we hypothesize\nthat:\nH1: Ambidextrous leadership positively relates\nto employee's innovative work behaviors.\n3.2.2 The Mediating Role of\nDecision-making Autonomy (DMA)\nProviding individuals with a great level of lat-\nitude to choose their own paths or make decisions\nat work is referred to as decision making autono-\nmy in organizations (Dornbusch et al., 1985).\nAccording to Carayon and Gurses (2008), DMA\ngives a person the freedom to make decisions\nwithout interference from others or compulsion.\nThis includes the capacity to come up with, organ-\nize, and carry out plans of action based on in-\ndividual preferences and judgements. They con-\ntended that developing innovation and creativity\nwithin organizations requires DMA.\nThe way a leader leads has a significant impact\non how freely employees can make decisions at\nwork. For instance, according to a study, manag-\ners or leaders who are more supportive and partic-\nipative tend to give employees more autonomy\n(Parker and Collins, 2010). Some studies have\nalso shown that transformational leadership is\npositively associated with DMA (G�zukara, and\nSimsek, 2015). Transformational leaders are more\nlikely to create a climate of trust, respect, and\nopen communication, which facilitates DMA\n(Bass and Riggio, 2006). In addition, it has been\nestablished that democratic leadership styles are\npositively associated with greater DMA (Dorgham\nand Al-Mahmoud, 2013). However, autocratic\nleadership style was found to be associated with\nless autonomy (Dorgham and Al-Mahmoud,\n2013).\nWe argue that in the semiconductor industry,\nas a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders\n(opening leadership behavior), they provide em-\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n7\nployees opportunities for independent thinking\nand acting as well as giving room for own ideas.\nThis provides employees with the sense of au-\ntonomy to make decisions on their own and further\nexhibit more IWB (Ahearne et al., 2008). Likewise,\njobs that are more complex and require higher\nlevels of skill and knowledge tend to offer more\nDMA to employees (Wu et al., 2015). Based on\nthe ambidexterity theory of leadership for in-\nnovation (Rosing et al., 2011), we contend that\nwith the complexity and competitive nature of\nthe semiconductor industry, AL offers workers\nthe DMA to use their knowledge, skills and abil-\nities to make high-quality decisions which im-\nprove IWB. In addition, the social exchange theory\nemphasize that good deeds should be reciprocated\n(Blau, 2017). Therefore, we argue that, employees\nsee AL as one of the best leadership styles that\nprovides them with DMA. Compared to other\nleadership styles (e.g autocratic leadership) that\nrestricts DMA, employees will psychologically\ninterpret DMA under AL as a benefit they have\nreceived from the company. As such, they feel\nobligated to reciprocate such benefit by exhibiting\nmore IWB. Grounded in the above discussion,\nwe hypothesize that:\nH2: Decision-making autonomy mediates the re-\nlationship between ambidextrous leadership\nand innovative work behavior.\n3.2.3 The Mediating Role of Workplace\nLearning (WL)\nW orkplace learning (WL) is the formal or in-\nformal acquisition of knowledge or skills that\ntakes place at a job (Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006).\nFormal training programs, on - the-job training,\ncoaching and mentoring, job rotations, and com-\nmunities of practice are just a few examples of\nthe many diverse ways that WL can take place.\nBusinesses must take into consideration, the na-\nture of work, the skills and knowledge required,\nand the preferences of learners whenever they\ndecide to choose any type of workplace learning.\nSome prior studies have identified some factors\nthat affect workplace learning. For instance, a\nstudy by Huang (2021) revealed that personal\nfactors (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation and learn-\ning styles), environmental factors (e.g., global-\nization, technology and changes in nature of\nwork), and organizational factors (e.g., leadership,\norganizational culture and support for learning)\nall influence WL. According to Zhang et al. (2019),\nAL positively influence team learning and team\nlearning also influences team performance. At\nthe individual level, Jansen et al. (2016) estab-\nlished that AL positively influence individual\nlearning and which in turn positively influences\norganizational learning. The effects of AL on WL\nand innovation in the setting of Chinese firms\nwas examined by Yang et al. (2021). The re-\nsearchers found that AL positively influences WL\nand this in turn positively impacts innovation\nperformance. Notable range of elements including\norganizational culture, individual personalities\nand firm structure, may affect how successful\nAL is at encouraging WL. According to a research,\nambidextrous leadership is more effective in or-\nganizations that work in fast -paced and dynamic\nindustries (like technology), where innovation is\nnecessary for success (Tushman and O'Reilly,\n1996).\nWe argue that in the semiconductor industry,\nas a characteristic of ambidextrous leaders\n(opening leadership behavior), they allow errors\nand encourage error thinking. In addition, by\n8\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nsanctioning errors (closing leadership behavior),\nemployees pay attention to uniform task accom-\nplishment and learn from their mistakes.\nMoreover, ambidextrous leaders foster WL by\ncreating a culture of learning, encouraging ex-\nploration and exploitation activities, and creating\nopportunities for employees to learn from each\nother. This can be done through formal training\nprograms, coaching, mentoring, or informal\nknowledge sharing. By encouraging employees\nto share knowledge and expertise, ambidextrous\nleaders can create a culture of collaboration and\ncontinuous learning (Eesley and Roberts, 2012).\nBased on the ambidexterity theory of leadership\nfor innovation, WL will increase employees desire\nto remain in the organization and when such top\ntalents are retained, they feel motivated to engage\nin IWB. Furthermore, WL that occurs as a result\nof AL in the company, will be interpreted by work-\ners as a good gesture they have received from\nthe company. They feel encouraged to repay the\norganization by engaging in IWB. Thus, we hy-\npothesize that:\nH3: Workplace learning mediates the relationship\nbetween ambidextrous leadership and in-\nnovative work behavior.\n3.2.4 The Moderating Role of Resistance to\nChange (RC)\nChange is inevitable in any organization as it\nis an essential component of growth, innovation\nand competitiveness. Change can be either re-\nactive or proactive and may involve different ele-\nments such as organizational structure, culture,\nleadership, policies and procedures, systems and\ntechnology. However, employees' resistance to\nchange is a major barrier to implementing change\nsuccessfully. Resistance to change (RC) is a mul-\nti-dimensional construct that refers to employees'\nnegative reactions, behaviors and attitudes to-\nwards change initiatives (Armenakis and Bedeian,\n1999).\nIn organizations, employees may resist change\nfor several reasons. First, employees may resist\nchange because they fear the uncertainty and po-\ntential negative outcomes associated with it (Holt\net al., 2007). They may not have a clear under-\nstanding of the reasons for the change, how it\nwill affect them or what their role will be in the\nnew setup. Employees may also resist change\nwhen they feel that such changes can threaten\ntheir sense of control and autonomy over their\nwork, leading to resistance (Oreg, 2006). They\nmay feel that their expertise, skills and experience\nare undervalued or that they will have less input\ninto decision - making processes. Likewise, em-\nployees may resist change if they do not trust\nthe motives or capabilities of the management\nteam leading the change initiative (Ford et al.,\n2008).\nSome of the consequences of employees' resist-\nance to change is that, it can lead to decreased\nproductivity as employees may be less motivated,\nengaged and committed to their work (Armenakis\nand Harris, 2002). In addition, it can increase costs\nfor the organization as it may require additional\nresources to address employees' concerns, pro-\nvide training and support, or manage conflicts\n(Choi and Ruona, 2011). Moreover, resistance to\nchange can lower employee morale and job sat-\nisfaction as employees may feel undervalued, dis-\nrespected or powerless (Armenakis and Harris,\n2002).\nPrevious studies suggest that RC plays an im-\nportant role in the relationship between leadership\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n9\nstyle and workplace learning. For instance, prior\nresearch found that transformational leadership\nhad a positive effect on WL, but this effect was\nweaker when employees had a higher level of\nresistance to change (Gupta and Pathak, 2022;\nJaved et al., 2019; Kim and Beehr, 2017). It was\nfound that participative leadership had a positive\neffect on learning, but this effect was weaker\nwhen employees had a higher level of RC (Kim\nand Beehr, 2017). A related study that surveyed\nvarious industries in China found that AL affects\nworkplace learning, and employee RC moderates\nthis relationship (Yang et al., 2015).\nIn this study, we contend that, in the semi-\nconductor industry, AL can be an effective strat-\negy for promoting WL, but its effectiveness may\ndepend on the level of employee RC. As such\nwhen employees' RC is low, the positive relation-\nship between AL and WL is stronger. On the\nother hand, when employees' RC is high, the pos-\nitive relationship between AL and WL is weaker.\nBased on these assertions, we hypothesize that:\nH4: Employees resistance to change moderates\nthe relationship between ambidextrous lead-\nership and workplace learning.\n3.2.5 The Moderating Role of Openness to\nExperience (OE)\nOpenness to experience (OE) is one of the \"Big\nFive\" personality traits. According to DeYoung\n(2015), OE is \"the extent to which people are\nresponsive to new and diverse experiences, in-\ncluding artistic, intellectual, and sensory experi-\nences, and the extent to which they seek out and\nengage with such experiences.\" Further, DeYoung\n(2015) stressed that those with high openness\nscores are frequently curious, innovative, and cre-\native individuals who enjoy discovering new\nthings. They are more likely to question estab-\nlished views and values and have a propensity\nfor unusual and abstract thinking. Conversely,\nthose with low openness tend to be more conven-\ntional and prefer tried and-true concepts and\npractices. They could be less likely to seek out\nnovel experiences or challenge accepted stand-\nards since they feel more at ease with the known\nand the familiar. It has been suggested that in-\ndividuals who are high in OE are more likely\nto engage in innovative behaviors (De Dreu, 2006)\nand are more receptive to change and new ideas\n(Gupta and Krishnan, 2004).\nLiterature suggests that the relationship be-\ntween leadership styles and IWB has been wide-\nly studied in organizational research. However,\ninconsistent results have been obtained due to\nthe lack of focus on how individual variations,\nsuch as OE's, can moderate this association. As\na result, when analyzing the relationship be-\ntween leadership styles and IWB, it's crucial to\ntake into account the importance of OE. A study\nfound that OE moderated the relationship be-\ntween participative leadership and IWB (Hirst et\nal., 2009). Some studies revealed that trans-\nformational leadership had a stronger positive\nimpact on IWB for employees who were high in\nOE (Karwowski, 2019; Gong et al., 2009; Shin\nand Zhou, 2007). Likewise, it was established\nthat authentic leadership had a stronger positive\nimpact on IWB for employees who were high in\nOE (Bai et al., 2022).\nOn the other hand, some studies have reported\nconflicting findings. For example, Wang and Zhu\n(2011) found that the relationship between trans-\nformational leadership and IWB was stronger for\nemployees who were low in OE. Similarly, a study\n10\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nconducted by Zhang and Bartol (2010), found that\ntransactional leadership had a weaker positive\nimpact on IWB for employees who were high\nin OE. It was established that OE did not moderate\nthe relationship between transformational leader-\nship and creative performance (Shin and Zhou,\n2007).\nWe argue that, in the semiconductor industry,\nemployees' OE will moderate the relationship be-\ntween AL and IWB. Specifically, employees who\nare high in OE may be more receptive to the\nexploratory approach to innovation favored by\nambidextrous leaders. They may be more willing\nto take risks, experiment with new ideas, and\nexplore new opportunities. On the other hand,\nemployees who are low in OE may be more com-\nfortable with the exploitative approach to in-\nnovation favored by traditional leaders. They may\nbe more focused on optimizing existing processes\nand products, and less willing to take risks or\nexplore new ideas. Therefore, the effectiveness\nof AL in promoting IWB will depend on the level\nof OE of the employees. Based on these argu-\nments, we hypothesize that:\nH5: Employees openness to experience moderates\nthe relationship between ambidextrous lead-\nership and innovative work behavior.\n4. Empirical Analysis\n4.1 Data Collection and Analysis Method\nThe semiconductor industry in Korea employs\nover 190,000 people (KSIA, 2020). The current\nstudy purposively selected employees of semi-\nconductor companies operating in Korea. A pur-\nposive sample is one whose features have been\ndefined for a specific reason that is relevant to\nthe study's objectives (Andrade, 2021). The\nmodel was empirically examined using survey\nquestionnaire data collected from employees of\nsemiconductor industry in Korea from March 15,\n2023 - March 21, 2023. The data was collected\nwith the assistance of a data gathering company\nin Korea called Invight. Sample size of 300 em-\nployees was used for further analysis. This\nmeets the sample size suggested by extant liter-\nature in undertaking a partial least square equa-\ntion model (PLS-SEM) analysis (Ringle et al.,\n2015; Hair et al., 2011). Data processing and\nanalysis were done through the use of both\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS\nv24) and SMART PLS-SEM (Version 4.0).\nWhen examining numerous variables and a\nlarge number of items, PLS-SEM helps resolve\nsample size issues (Hair et al., 2017). PLS-SEM\ncan also be employed with more small -scale\nsamples (Rigdon, 2016).\n4.2 Questionnaire Composition\nThe scales measuring the items were obtained\nfrom some previous empirical studies. To meas-\nure the attitude and opinion of the respondents\non the concepts under the study, the participants\nresponded to all items using a 5-point Likert\nscale, that ranges from \"1 = strongly disagree\"\n\" The scales were vetted\nto \"5 = strongly agree.\nto validate their applicability in the context of\nthe study before they were used for the data\ncollection.\nAmbidextrous leadership (AL): To measure\nAL, the researchers adopted 14 items by (Rosing\net al., 2011). The items comprise of opening and\nclosing leadership behaviors. Sample items of the\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n11\nscale are \"The leader allows different ways of\naccomplishing a task,\" \"The leader reasons to\ntake risks,\" and \"The leader encourages error\nlearning.\"\nInnovative work behavior (IWB): A scale was\nadopted to measure IWB from De Jong and Den\nHartog (2010). A total of 10 items were used in\nthe study. Sample items of the scale are \"I gen-\nerate original solutions for problems, \"I attempt\nto convince people to support an innovative\nidea, \" and \"I contribute to the implementation of\nnew ideas. \"\nDecision making autonomy (DMA): To eval-\nuate DMA, the current investigation adapted the\nDMA Scale consisting of 9 items established by\nMorgeson (2006). Sample items include: \"The job\nallows me to make my own decisions about how\nto schedule my work, \" and \"The job allows me\nto make decisions about what methods I use to\ncomplete my work.\"\nW orkplace learning (WL): The scale for WL\nwas adopted from Fontana et al. (2015), which\ncomprised of 11 items. Sample items of the scale\nare \"I acquire new information at my workplace,\"\n\"The leader reasons to take risks, \" and \"I ask\ncolleagues for advice.\"\nResistance to change (RC): A scale was adapted\nto measure RC from Kim et al. (2022). A total\nof 4 items were used in the study. Sample items\nof the scale are \"Changing the organizational sys-\ntem seems like a hassle to me, \" and \"If my com-\npany changes the organizational system, I would\nresist it even if I think the change may ultimately\n\"\nbenefit me.\nOpenness to experience (OE): OE was meas-\nured using scale developed by John and\nSrivastava (1999). It consists of 10 items. Sample\nitems include: \"I am curious about many different\nthings,\" \"I prefer work that is exciting,\" and \"I\nam ingenious, a deep thinker.\"\n4.3 Sample Characteristics\nThe demographic information shows that males\nrepresented 81.7% (245) and females represented\n18.3% (55) of the sample. Majority of the partic-\nipants 47.3% (142) were between 40-49 years.\nMost of the participants 76.0% (228) were gradu-\nates with bachelor degree and 13.0% (39) were\nmaster degree holders. Majority of the re-\nspondents 23.7% (71) have worked in the semi-\nconductor industry for 16 years and above. About\n33.3% (100) of the participants had worked in\ntheir current organization for 5 years or less.\n48.3% (145) of the respondents were departmental\nhead/deputy managers. Most of the respondents\n(28.3%) provide management support. The details\nof the sample characteristics are provided in\n<Table 1>.\n<Table 1> Sample Characteristics\nCharacteristics Frequency Percentage (%)\n Gender\n Male 245 81.7\n Female 55 18.3\n Age\n Under 20 years 0 0\n 20~29 years 13 4.3\n 30~39 years 85 28.3\n 40~49 years 142 47.3\n 50 years and above 60 20.0\n Education\n High school 24 8.0\n Graduate 228 76.0\n Masters 39 13.0\n12\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nCharacteristics Frequency Percentage (%)\n PhD 9 3.0\n Years of service in semiconductor industry\n 5 years or less 28 9.3\n 6~10 years 50 16.7\n 11 ~ 15 years 85 28.3\n 16 years and above 137 45.7\n Years of service in current semiconductor company\n 5 years or less 100 33.3\n 6~ 10 years 77 25.7\n 11 ~ 15 years 52 17.3\n 16 years and above 71 23.7\n Position/rank\n Employee 32 10.7\n Assistant manager 115 38.3\n Dep't head/deputy manager 145 48.3\n Executive officer 8 2.7\n Department\n Production 72 24.0\n Management support 85 28.3\n Sales/marketing 36 12.0\n R&D 72 24.0\n Other 35 11.7\n4.4 Measurement Model Assessment\nFollowing the disjoint two-stage approach\nBecker (2012), the measurement model of the low-\ner order construct was first assessed by examin-\ning two types of validity: convergent validity and\ndiscriminant validity.\n4.4.1 Convergent Validity\nThe convergent validity is ascertained by ex-\namining the loadings, average variance ex-\ntracted (AVE) and the composite reliability (CR)\n(Rahman et al., 2015; Gholami et al., 2013). The\nloadings were all significant above the cut-off\nvalue 0.50 as suggested by Hair et al. (2017).\n<Table 2> shows that the composite reliabilities\nwere all above the 0.70 threshold (Roldan et al.,\n2017) while average variance extracted (AVE)\ncoefficients met the 0.5 threshold suggesting\nadequate convergent validity (Fornell and\nLarcker, 1981).\n<Table 2> Composite Reliability(CR) & Average\nVariance Extracted (AVE)\nCR AVE\n CLB 0.881 0.517\n DMA 0.935 0.616\n IWB 0.938 0.601\n OE 0.930 0.571\n OLB 0.918 0.618\n RC 0.819 0.535\n WL 0.928 0.54\nNotes: OLB= Opening Leadership Behavior; CLB =\nClosing Leadership Behavior; IWB = Innovative\nWork Behavior; DMA = Decision Making\nAutonomy; WL = Workplace Learning; RC =\nResistance to Change; OE = Openness to\nExperience.\n4.4.2 Discriminant Validity\nThe heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correla-\ntions (HTMT) is a relatively and consistently\nnovel mechanism to assess discriminant val-\nidity in SEM (Henseler et al., 2014). In a stricter\nmethod to employ HTMT, a threshold value of\n0.85 has been suggested (Hair et al., 2019;\nKline, 2023), while some academic SEM re-\nsearchers backed a more flexible value of 0.90\n(Garson, 2016; Henseler et al., 2015). <Table 3>\nshows that our HTMT were within acceptable\nthreshold.\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n13\n<Table 3> HTMT of Lower Order Construct\nCLB DMA IWB OE OLB RC WL RC X CLB RC X OLB OE X OLB OE X CLB\n CLB           \n DMA 0.324          \n IWB 0.525 0.646         \n OE 0.355 0.409 0.655        \n OLB 0.704 0.628 0.312 0.651 0.251 0.354 0.198 0.394      \n RC WL 0.413 0.52 0.631 0.766 0.561 0.629 0.269     \n RC X CLB 0.124 0.048 0.043 0.23 0.083 0.231 0.038    \n RC X OLB 0.095 0.057 0.079 0.266 0.153 0.083 0.056 0.637   \n OE X OLB 0.189 0.094 0.069 0.05 0.141 0.263 0.112 0.065 0.062  \n OE X CLB 0.142 0.12 0.192 0.035 0.204 0.225 0.133 0.084 0.062 0.665\nNotes: OLB = Opening Leadership Behavior; CLB = Closing Leadership Behavior; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior;\nDMA = Decision-Making Autonomy; WL = Workplace Learning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE = Openness\nto Experience.\n4.4.3 Validating Higher Order Constructs-\nConvergent Validity & Discriminant\nValidity\nThe higher order construct (ambidextrous\nleadership) was validated as part of the measure-\nment model assessment. This construct was as-\nsessed for reliability and convergent validity. In\naddition, as recommended by Kline (2023), the\nhigher order construct was tested for discriminant\nvalidity with other lower constructs. The results\nshow that the loadings reliability and convergent\nvalidity of the higher order construct and the other\nconstructs are acceptable as the value of compo-\nsite reliability is above 0.70 and the AVE is greater\nthan 0.50 (see <Table 4>). With regards to dis-\ncriminant validity, the results of the HTMT (see\n<Table 5>) is below the 0.90 threshold (Garson,\n2016; Henseler et al., 2015).\n<Table 4> Composite Reliability (CR) & Average\nVariance Extracted (AVE)\nCR AVE\n DMA 0.935 0.616\n IWB 0.938 0.601\n OE 0.93 0.571\n RC 0.819 0.535\n WL 0.928 0.54\nNotes: IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA\nDecision Making Autonomy; WL = Workplace\nLearning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE =\nOpenness to Experience.\n<Table 5> HTMT of Higher Order Constructs\nDMA IWB OE RC WL OE X AL RC x AL\n DMA       \n IWB 0.646      \n OE 0.409 0.655     \n RC 0.312 0.251 0.198    \n WL 0.631 0.766 0.561 0.269   \n OE X AL 0.099 0.091 0.046 0.269 0.118  \n RC x AL 0.057 0.075 0.273 0.085 0.055 0.031\nNotes: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA = Decision-Making Autonomy;\nWL = Workplace Learning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE = Openness to Experience.\n14\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n4.5 The Structural Model Assessment\nThe structural model examines the causal con-\nnections between a model's latent constructs\n(Mumtaz et al., 2017). Researchers must first solve\nthe collinearity problem in order to prevent any\nbiases in regression results, and SEM researchers\nsuggested utilizing VIF - Variance Inflation\nFactor to analyze the collinearity (Mumtaz et al.,\n2017). Likewise, if all VIFs from a thorough colli-\nnearity test are equal to or lower than 3.3, the\nmodel can be said to be free of common method\nbias (Kock, 2015). The study was unaffected by\ncollinearity problems because the VIF values re-\nported for each latent construct in our inves-\ntigation were all less than 3.3. In addition, to test\nthe model fit, we assessed the standardized root\nmean square (SRMR). The SRMR value for the\nstudy model is 0.059 less than 0.08 which indicates\na good model fit (Henseler et al., 2013).\n4.5.1 Direct Relations\nUsing 5,000 bootstrap samples and a sample\nsize of 300 employees, the current study used\nthe bootstrapping approach to assess the path\ncoefficients and their significance in accordance\nwith Hair et al. (2019). First, H1 hypothesized\nthat AL positively impacts IWB. The results\n(<Table 6>) show a positive relationship between\nAL and IWB (� = 0.218, t = 3.348, p < 0.00).\nTherefore, H1 is supported. The predictive power\nof the independent variable was disclosed with\nIWB having the largest variance explained\n(0.652), followed by WL (0.370), and DMA (0.315).\n4.5.2 Specific Indirect Relations\nThe mediation hypotheses were tested follow-\ning the approach used by (Nitzl et al, 2016; Roldan\net al., 2017). In hypotheses 2 & 3, the study pro-\nposed that DMA and WL respectively would me-\ndiate the effect of AL on IWB. <Table 7> shows\n<Table 6> Results of Structural Model Assessment for Direct Relation\nPercentile Bootstrap 95%  \n Confidence Interval \n Hypothesis Coefficient T-Value P-Value Bci LI Bci UI F2 Decision\n H1: Al→Iwb 0.218* 3.348 0.000 0.117 0.331 0.078 Supported\nNotes: AI = Ambidextrous Leadership; Iwb = Innovative Work Behavior; Bci LI = Bias Corrected Interval Lower\nLimit; Bci U1 = Bias Corrected Interval Upper Limit; *P く 0.05\n<Table 7> Results of structural model assessment for indirect effects\nPercentile Bootstrap 95%\n Confidence Interval\n Hypotheses Relationship Coefficient t-value P-value BCI LL BCI UL Decision\n Direct AL→IWB 0.218* 3.348 0.000 0.117 0.331 \n Indirect H2: AL→DMA→IWB 0.097* 2.652 0.004 0.040 0.160 Supported\n  H3: AL→WL→IWB 0.192* 3.079 0.001 0.104 0.314 Supported\n Total effect AL→IWB 0.507* 7.944 0.000 0.407 0.612\nNotes: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA = Decision Making Autonomy;\nWL = Workplace Learning; RC = Resistance to Change; OE = Openness to Experience; BCI LL = Bias Corrected\nInterval Lower Limit; BCI UL = Bias Corrected Interval Upper Limit; *P<0.05.\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n15\nthat AL has a significant direct effect on IWB.\nFurthermore, all the indirect effects of AL on IWB\nare significant. The results indicate significant\n(p < 0.05) partial mediating roles of DMA (H2:\n� = 0.097, t = 2.652, p く 0.05) and WL (H3: B\n= 0.192, t = 3.079, p く 0.05). The total effect of\nAL on IWB was significant (� = 0.507, t = 7.944,\np = 0.000). With the inclusion of the mediators\nthe direct effect was still significant (B = 0.218,\nt = 3.348, p = 0.000). Hence, DMA and WL partially\nmediated the relationship between AL and IWB.\nThe results provide strong support for hypotheses\n2 & 3.\n4.5.3 Moderating Effects\nThe hypothesis (H4) sought to ascertain the\nmoderating role of resistance to change (RC) in\nthe relationship between AL and WL. The results\nrevealed that RC moderated the relationship be-\ntween AL and WL as it was significant (B=0.035,\nt=1.822, p=0.034). The moderation results indicate\nthat RC interacts with AL and WL. The simple\nslope shows that beyond the point of interaction,\nRC is positively interacting with itself and that\nof AL and WL. In addition, it reveals that when\nRC is low, the relationship between AL and WL\nwill be stronger than when RC is high. Hence,\nour hypothesis (H4) was supported. [Figure 2]\nshows the simple slope analysis. However, our\nhypothesis 5, which predicted that OE will moder-\nate the relationship between AL and IWB was\nnot supported.\nChart Title: RC x ALX-Axis: ALY-Axis: WLChart Type: line\n  RC at -1 SD RC at Mean RC at +1 SD\n item_01 0.686 0.206 0.814\n<Table 8> Summary of Results\nHypothesis No. Hypothesis Direction Decision\n Hypothesis 1 AL→IWB Supported\n Hypothesis 2 AL→DMA→IWB Supported\n Hypothesis 3 AL→WL→IWB Supported\n Hypothesis 4 RCxAL→WL Supported\n Hypothesis 5 OExAL→IWB Not supported\n[Figure 2] Simple Slope Analysis\n16\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\n4.5.4 Post-hoc Analysis\nIn our post-hoc analysis, we conducted mul-\nti-group analysis and observed that the 3 criteria\nor test for multi-group analysis (MGA, para-\nmetric test, and Welch-Satterthwait test) were\nall significant because P-values were less than\n0.05. In addition, we established that there is a\nmoderating effect or significant differences.\nSpecifically, there is a significant variation be-\ntween young and old-aged employees in terms\nof the effect of DMA on IWB. Again, we observed\nthe significant variations between employees in\nlow and high ranked positions in terms of their\neffect on AL and DMA. The results are summar-\nized in <Table 9>.\nWe assessed the bootstrapping results for\nfurther analysis. The bootstrapping results in\nTable 10 revealed that although age has sig-\nnificant impact on DMA → IWB, old aged em-\nployees have strong and significant impact than\nyoung aged employees. This can be attributed\nto the fact that, old aged employees in the\nKorean semiconductor industry have a lot of\nwork experience than the young employees. As\nsuch, compared to the young employees, the old\naged employees have high sense of judgment to\nmake decisions on their own, take personal ini-\ntiative, and enjoy considerable independence and\nfreedom which enable them to generate original\nsolutions for problems and as well introduce in-\nnovative ideas which reflect IWB. As such, our\nresults reveal that in the Korean context, old\naged employees in the semiconductor industry\nhave higher IWB than young employees. This\nfinding of our study is supported by Stoffers et\nal. (2018), who also found that old aged employ-\nees have stronger influence on IWB than young\nemployees in small and medium-sized enter-\nprises in Netherland.\nLikewise, the bootstrapping results show that\nalthough position/rank has significant positive\nimpact on AL → DMA, employees in high ranked\npositions (e.g departmental heads and executive\nofficers) have strong and significant impact than\nemployees in low ranked positons (e.g junior\nstaff/assistant manager). This shows that in a\nsemiconductor business with AL, workers in high\nranked positions possess more DMA than work-\ners in low ranked positions. This is also a reflection\nof the Korean work culture which gives more\nDMA to people in higher position (seniority).\nMoreover, we observed that although there was\nno moderation effect for gender in terms of the\nAL → IWB relationship, females had more sig-\nnificant impact than males. This implies that, in\nthe presence of AL, females contribute more to\nIWB than males. The results are summarized in\n<Table 10>.\n<Table 9> Multi-group Analysis\nRelationship Difference MGA P-value Parametric test P-value Welch-Satterthwait test P-value\n DMA → IWB (Age_young - Age_old) = -0.222 0.023* 0.036* 0.023*\n AL → DMA (POS_JA - POS_DE) = -0.138 0.045* 0.048* 0.050°\nNotes: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative Work Behavior; DMA = Decision Making Autonomy;\nAge_young = Young aged employees; Age_old = Old aged employees; POS_JA = Junior staff and assistant\nmanagers; POS_DE = Departmental heads and executive officers; *P < 0.05.\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n17\n<Table 10> Bootstrapping Results\nRelationship Original T- value P- value\n DMA → IWB Age_young = 0.051 0.634 0.263\n Age_old = 0.273 3,566 0.000\n AL → DMA Pos_JA = 0.508 7.023 0.000\n Pos_DE = 0.646 15.407 0.000\n AL → IWB Male = 0.184 2.515 0.006\n Female = 0.324 2.199 0.014\nNote: AL = Ambidextrous Leadership; IWB = Innovative\nWork Behavior; DMA=Decision Making Autonomy;\nAge_young = Young aged employees; Age_old\n= Old aged employees; POS_JA = Junior staff and\nassistant managers; POS _DE = Departmental\nheads and executive officers.\n5. Discussion, Implications,\nLimitations and Conclusion\n5.1 Discussion\nAlthough prior research has shown mixed re-\nsults, leadership is usually regarded as a key pre-\ndictor of individual, team, and organizational-\nlevel innovation (Hammond et al., 2011; Rosing\net al., 2011). Using the AL theory of innovation,\nthis study assessed the impact of AL on IWB\nand the indirect effect of AL on IWB through\nDMA and WL. In addition, the study investigated\nthe moderating effect of RC in the relationship\nbetween AL and WL. Moreover, we assessed the\nmoderating role of OE in the relationship between\nAL and IWB.\nOur study supported hypothesis 1 which pre-\ndicted that AL positively impact IWB. The results\nshow that the opening and closing leadership be-\nhaviors of ambidextrous leaders encourage em-\nployees in the semiconductor industry of Korea\nto engage in more IWB. This underlines the rele-\nvance of ambidextrous leader behaviors (opening\nand closing behaviors) in the IWB process of em-\nployees (Zacher et al., 2016; Zacher and Rosing,\n2015). When ambidextrous leaders encourage\nemployees to experiment with new ideas and also\ntake corrective action, it promotes IWB of\nemployees.\nThe results of our study supported hypotheses\n2 which predicted the indirect effect of AL on\nIWB through DMA. Prior research focused pre-\ndominantly on employee traits such as creative\nself-efficacy (Gong et al., 2009), identification\nwith the leader (Wang and Rode, 2010) and crea-\ntive identity (Wang and Zhu, 2011) as mediators\nbetween leadership and employee innovation\nbehaviors. Our study reveals that DMA is an\nimportant mediator between AL and IWB in the\nsemiconductor industry. For instance, AL behav-\niors such as opening leadership behaviors offer\nworkers the opportunity to independently think\nand act. Such privilege which is considered as\na form of work autonomy, enable workers to think\noutside the box to deliver IWBs such as develop-\nment of new products or services that seeks to\nbenefit their organization. In addition, the AL\ntheory suggests that a balance between explora-\ntion of new ideas and exploitation of existing ones\ncan be applied according to the situational re-\nquirements of creativity and implementation\n(Rosing et al., 2011). From the results of our study,\none of the situation requirements that ignite IWB\nis the DMA provided to employees by ambidex-\ntrous leaders.\nHypotheses 3 which was also supported pre-\ndicted the indirect effect of AL on IWB through\nWL. The application of AL theory encourages\nworkers to learn on the job (Rosing et al., 2011).\nIn the semiconductor industry, such positive be-\nhaviors of ambidextrous leaders ensure that\n18\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nworkers learn new skills and approaches on the\njob. Workers do not only learn the new skills\nthey acquire on the job but also generate IWB\nthat add value to the quality of work in their\ncompanies. Likewise, based on social exchange\ntheory, workers perceive AL as a good leadership\nstyle that they have received from an organization\nwhich motivates them to learn. This places an\nobligation on workers to reciprocate such benefits\nby exhibiting IWB which benefits the entire\norganization.\nMoreover, the moderated mediation (hypothe-\nsis 4) of the study was supported. Hypothesis\n4 predicted that RC will moderate the relationship\nbetween AL and WL. The interaction reveals that\nin the presence of AL, RC is an important moder-\nation condition or factor for WL to be more effec-\ntive in generating IWB from workers. As such,\nAL can be an effective strategy for promoting\nworkplace learning, but its effectiveness may de-\npend on the level of employee resistance to change.\nLeaders must be aware of employees' resistance\nto change and take steps to reduce it in order\nto maximize the point of impact of AL on WL.\nThis has the potential to also foster IWB.\nHowever, hypothesis 5 which predicted that\nOE will moderate the relationship between AL\nand IWB was not supported. This may be attrib-\nuted to the fact that individuals from Western\ncultures, such as the United States and Western\nEurope (more individualistic cultures) tend to\nscore higher on measures of openness to experi-\nence compared to individuals from non - Western\ncultures, such as East Asia (more collectivistic\ncultures) and Africa (Oishi et al., 2013; McCrae\nand Costa Jr, 1997). It is also possible that because\nof the industry characteristics and the busy work\nschedule of employees, they have less time to\nengage in IWB. Future research should further\ninvestigate this relationship.\n5.2 Implications\n5.2.1 Theoretical Implications\nThis study makes significant contributions to\nthe field of research on the semiconductor in-\ndustry by offering the first concrete evidence of\nAL in the industry and by making recom-\nmendations for how to best utilize leadership be-\nhaviors to foster employee IWB. There is a lack\nof consensus regarding the best ways to develop\nleadership and apply leadership theories in re-\nal -world situations (Bagheri, 2017; Iles and\nPreece, 2006). We believe that despite the in-\ndustry's limited resources, it is vital to examine\nambidextrous leadership in the context of the\nsemiconductor industry to enable industry play-\ners' deal with the dynamic and competitive nature\nof the sector to encourage employee IWB.\nIn addition, our research offers real empirical\nsupport for the AL theory and for the development\nof theories about IWB and leadership in the semi-\nconductor sector. This research reveals both the\ncomplexity of the relationship between leadership\nbehaviors and employee IWB (Oluwafemi, 2020).\nAs suggested by Rosing et al. (2011), AL theory\nis an important concept to help understand how\nleaders can balance the opening behaviors\n(exploration of new ideas) with the closing behav-\niors (exploitation of existing ones) to foster IWB.\nLikewise, our study provided empirical support\nand validated the roles of DMA and WL as inter-\nmediary mechanisms linking ambidextrous lead-\nership to IWB. Therefore, we extend AL theory\nby suggesting DMA and WL as important media-\ntors to examine the relationship between AL and\nAmbidextrous Leadership and Innovative Work Behavior\n19\nIWB. AL promotes exploration and exploitation\nbehaviors among subordinates (Rosing et al.,\n2011) resulting in their autonomy, learning and\nenergy, which in turn leads to employee's IWB\n(Wallace et al., 2016).\nMoreover, our research extends the literature\non AL by replicating the positive relationship of\nopening and closing leader behaviors for a Korean\nsample as prior studies have been conducted with\nsamples from Germany (Gerlach et al., 2020), the\nUSA (Zacher et al., 2016) and Australia (Zacher\nand Wilden, 2014; Zacher and Rosing, 2015).\nLastly, the study contributes to the social ex-\nchange theory (SET) in the context of leadership\nand semiconductor industry by emphasizing how\nworkers consider AL as an important leadership\nstyle received from the company. The AL style\nprovides workers with DMA and WL. The work-\ners replicate such good gesture by contributing\nto IWB which benefits the entire organization.\n5.2.2 Practical Implications\nFirst, our research reveals that in the presence\nof AL, employees are more likely to engage in\nIWB. Since employees respond positively to IWB,\nit places a responsibility on ambidextrous leaders\nto understand and effectively switch between be-\nhaviors (OLC & CLB) or a combination of the\ntwo. OLB promotes higher levels of workers ex-\nplorative IWB and that CLB is essential to foster\nemployees exploitative IWB. In addition, leaders\nusing AL should educate workers on how to react\npositively to AL in the work environment to foster\nIWB. For instance, ambidextrous leaders can edu-\ncate workers on the importance of establishing\nroutines, allowing errors, and giving room for\nemployee's novel ideas. Similarly, organizations\nshould make an investment in developing AL\ntraits in their leaders to create a work environment\nthat inspires employees to demonstrate more\nIWB.\nLikewise, the mediating role of DMA implies\nthat a continuous harmonious work environment\nshould be created for employees to have autonomy\nto engage in IWB. Moreover, WL in the form\nof training, seminars and mentorship should be\nencouraged. Furthermore, this study will be bene-\nficial to HR practitioners or managers in their\nleadership selection, training and development,\nsuccession planning and performance evaluation\nin the context of the semiconductor industry.\n5.3 Limitations and Directions for Future Research\nThe first limitation of our study is that the\nresults are country and context specific. Although\nSouth Korea is a major player in the global semi-\nconductor industry, concentrating on one country\nmay limit the generalizability of the findings. It\nwould be beneficial to undertake further research\non the semiconductor industry in other nations\nto see how generalizable the current findings are.\nFuture research could focus on semiconductor\nindustry in different settings to further validate\nthe AL theory. Second, data was collected from\nemployees in the semiconductor industry. This\ncould result in self-report bias and common meth-\nod bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). However, as men-\ntioned in the data analysis section, we im-\nplemented a number of measures to mitigate the\nrisks of common method bias, and our findings\nfrom the variance inflation factor (VIF) test in-\ndicate that common method variance is not a seri-\nous concern. To increase the likelihood of produc-\ning unbiased ratings, we advise including leaders,\npeers, and employees at all levels in future studies.\n20\nHenry Ameyaw Domfeh · Henry Ofori · Sora Yoon · Juyoung Kang\nThird, although we evaluated crucial contextual\nfactors such as DMA, WL, and RC characteristics\nrelevant to IWB in the current study, there may\nbe more contextual and individual antecedents\nthat require exploration (Zhou et al., 2008). Future\nresearch may examine other possible mediators\n(e.g., trust in leadership, & job security), and mod-\nerators (e.g., work environment, perceived organ-\nizational support, and level of education). Fourth,\nsome significant variables, such as years of expe-\nrience, salary level and employee job position,\ncould not be controlled for within the parameters\nof this research. Future research should focus\non these variables as well as the barriers to em-\nployee IWB that may exist at the individual, firm,\nand contextual levels.\n5.4 Conclusion\nThe semiconductor industry is one of the im-\nportant industries contributing to global develop-\nment. As such, appreciation of how leadership\nplays a significant role in the competitive industry\nto foster IWB cannot be overlooked. In this study,\ndrawing on the ambidextrous theory of leadership\nand social exchange theory, we have discussed\nhow IWB of employees in the semiconductor in-\ndustry can be fostered by AL style. Additionally,\nwe have discussed extensively how AL indirectly\ninfluences IWB through DMA and WL. More im-\nportantly, we have highlighted how RC play an\nimportant moderating role in the relationship be-\ntween AL and WL. The data gathered from em-\nployees in the semiconductor industry in Korea\nreveals that AL is critical to ensure IWB. We\nbelieve that the appropriate industry players will\ncontinue to make good use of AL especially in\nthe work environment to ensure continuous\ngrowth, innovation and success.\nReferences\nAfsar, B., Y.F.
